If we are missing an essential entry in the bibliography, provide us the following information, ideally in the BibTeX format and we will add it as soon as possible:
* Author(s)
* Title
* Type of publication (InProceedings, Journal Article, Technical Report, ...)
* Publication Year
* If available, additional Information such as
    * DOI
    * URL
    * Pages
    * Publisher
    * Volume and Number of the Journal
    * Abstract
    * The actual paper as PDF

Here is an example how such an entry could look like:
```
@Article{Rebelo2012,
  author    = {Rebelo, Ana and Fujinaga, Ichiro and Paszkiewicz, Filipe and Marcal, Andre R.S. and Guedes, Carlos and Cardoso, Jaime S.},
  title     = {Optical music recognition: state-of-the-art and open issues},
  journal   = {International Journal of Multimedia Information Retrieval},
  year      = {2012},
  volume    = {1},
  number    = {3},
  pages     = {173--190},
  doi       = {10.1007/s13735-012-0004-6},
  publisher = {Springer},
}
```
