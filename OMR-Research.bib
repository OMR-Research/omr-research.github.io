The client role is designated to a mobile application responsible for taking a photo of a score, sending it to the server for further processing and playing mp3 file received from the server. The server role is to recognize notes from the image, generate mp3 file and send it to the client application. The key element of the system is the program realizing the algorithm of notes recognition. It is based on the decision trees and characteristics of the individual symbols extracted from the image. The system is implemented in the Windows Phone 8 framework and uses a cloud operating system Microsoft Azure. It enables easy archivization of photos, recognized notes in the Music XML format and generated mp3 files. An easy transition to other mobile operating systems is possible as well as processing multiple music collections scans.},

This paper reports on the design of a pen-based input system that uses easily-learned gestures to facilitate fast input, particularly if the system must be portable. The design is based on observations of musicians writing music by hand, and an analysis of the symbols in samples of music. A preliminary evaluation of the system is presented, and the speed is compared with the alternatives of handwriting, synthesiser keyboard input, and optical music recognition. Evaluations suggest that the gesture-based system could be approximately three times as fast as other methods of music data entry reported in the literature.},

  abstract  = {Optical music recognition ({OMR}) involves identifying musical symbols on a scanned sheet of music, and interpreting them so that the music can either be played by the computer, or put into a music editor. Applications include providing an automatic accompaniment, transposing or extracting parts for individual instruments, and performing an automated musicological analysis of the music. A key problem with music recognition, compared with character recognition, is that symbols very often overlap on the page. The most significant form of this problem is that the symbols are superimposed on a five-line staff. Although the staff provides valuable positional information, it creates ambiguity because it is difficult to determine whether a pixel would be black or white if the staff line was not there. The other main difference between music recognition and character recognition is the set of permissible symbols. In text, the alphabet size is fixed. Conversely, in music notation there is no standard "alphabet" of shapes, with composers inventing new notation where necessary, and music for particular instruments using specialised notation where appropriate. The focus of this paper is on techniques we have developed to deal with superimposed objects (6 Refs.) recognition},

  abstract  = {Optical music recognition aims to convert the vast repositories of sheet music in the world into an on-line digital format. In the near future it will be possible to assimilate music into digital libraries and users will be able to perform searches based on a sung melody in addition to typical text-based searching. An important requirement for such a system is the ability to reproduce the original score as accurately as possible. Due to the huge amount of sheet music available, the efficient storage of musical images is an important topic of study. This paper investigates whether the "knowledge" extracted from the optical music recognition (OMR) process can be exploited to gain higher compression than the JBIG international standard for bi-level image compression. We present a hybrid approach where the primitive shapes of music extracted by the optical music recognition process-note heads, note stems, staff lines and so forth-are fed into a graphical symbol based compression scheme originally designed for images containing mainly printed text. Using this hybrid approach the average compression rate for a single page is improved by 3.5% over JBIG. When multiple pages with similar typography are processed in sequence, the file size is decreased by 4-8%. The relevant background to both optical music recognition and textual image compression is presented. Experiments performed on 66 test images are described, outlining the combinations of parameters that were examined to give the best results.},

Other techniques exist for acquiring music on-line; however, these methods require operators with musical and computer skills. The notion, therefore, of an entirely automated process through OMR is highly attractive. It has been an active area of research since its inception in 1966 (Pruslin), and even though there has been the development of many systems with impressively high accuracy rates it is surprising to note that there is little evidence of large collections being processed with the technology-work by Carter (1994) and Bainbridge and Carter (1997) being the only known notable exception. This paper outlines some of the insights gained, and algorithms implemented, through the practical experience of converting collections in excess of 400 pages. In doing so, the work demonstrates that there are additional factors not currently considered by other research centres that are necessary for OMR to reach its full potential.},

These systems generally have two phases: recognizing the graphical symbols (such as note-heads and lines) and determining the musical meaning and relationships of the symbols (such as the pitch and rhythm of the notes). In this paper we explore the second phase and give a two-step approach that admits an economical representation of the parsing rules for the system. The approach is flexible and allows the system to be extended to new notations with little effort—the current system can parse common music notation, Sacred Harp notation and plainsong. It is based on a string grammar and a customizable graph that specifies relationships between musical objects. We observe that this graph can be related to printing as well as recognizing music notation, bringing the opportunity for cross-fertilization between the two areas of research.

Many images of music scores are now available, often mixed up with textual documents and images.

In this paper we report on an investigation into methods to mechanically determine if a particular document is indeed a score, so that the user can specify that only musical scores should be returned. The goal is to find a minimal set of features that can be used as a quick test that will be applied to large numbers of documents.
A variety of filters were considered, and two promising ones (run-length ratios and Hough transform) were evaluated. We found that a method based around run-lengths in vertical scans (RL) that out-performs a comparable algorithm using the Hough transform (HT). On a test set of 1030 images, RL achieved recall and precision of 97.8% and 88.4% respectively while HT achieved 97.8% and 73.5%. In terms of processor time, RL was more than five times as fast as HT.},

Leveraging from Music Information Retrieval (MIR) techniques and Linked Open Data (LOD), in this paper we demonstrate a new form of music digital library that encompasses management, discovery, delivery, and analysis of the musical content it contains. Utilizing open source tools such as Greenstone, audioDB, Meandre, and Apache Jena we present a series of transformations to a musical digital library sourced from audio files that steadily increases the level of support provided to the user for musicological study. While the seed for this work was motivated by better supporting musicologists in a digital library, the developed software architecture alters the boundaries to what is conventionally thought of as a digital library- and in doing so challenges core assumptions made in mainstream digital library software design.

  abstract    = {In the year 1948, Barlow and Morgenstern published the book 'A Dictionary of Musical Themes', which contains 9803 important musical themes from the Western classical music literature. In this paper, we deal with the problem of automatically matching these themes to other digitally available sources. To this end, we introduce a processing pipeline that automatically extracts from the scanned pages of the printed book textual metadata using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) as well as symbolic note information using Optical Music Recognition (OMR). Due to the poor printing quality of the book, the OCR and OMR results are quite noisy containing numerous extraction errors. As one main contribution, we adjust alignment techniques for matching musical themes based on the OCR and OMR input. In particular, we show how the matching quality can be substantially improved by fusing the OCR- and OMR-based matching results. Finally, we report on our experiments within the challenging Barlow and Morgenstern scenario, which also indicates the potential of our techniques when considering other sources of musical themes such as digital music archives and the world wide web.},

  abstract = {Web services allow permanent access to music from all over the world. Especially in the case of web services with user-supplied content, e.g., YouTube(TM), the available metadata is often incomplete or erroneous. On the other hand, a vast amount of high-quality and musically relevant metadata has been annotated in research areas such as Music Information Retrieval (MIR). Although they have great potential, these musical annotations are ofter inaccessible to users outside the academic world. With our contribution, we want to bridge this gap by enriching publicly available multimedia content with musical annotations available in research corpora, while maintaining easy access to the underlying data. Our web-based tools offer researchers and music lovers novel possibilities to interact with and navigate through the content. In this paper, we consider a research corpus called the Weimar Jazz Database (WJD) as an illustrating example scenario. The WJD contains various annotations related to famous jazz solos. First, we establish a link between the WJD annotations and corresponding YouTube videos employing existing retrieval techniques. With these techniques, we were able to identify 988 corresponding YouTube videos for 329 solos out of 456 solos contained in the WJD. We then embed the retrieved videos in a recently developed web-based platform and enrich the videos with solo transcriptions that are part of the WJD. Furthermore, we integrate publicly available data resources from the Semantic Web in order to extend the presented information, for example, with a detailed discography or artists-related information. Our contribution illustrates the potential of modern web-based technologies for the digital humanities, and novel ways for improving access and interaction with digitized multimedia content.},

The resulting symbolic representation in terms of so called MIDI-EVENTs can be easily understood by musical devices such as synthesizers, expanders, or keyboards. },

  abstract  = {Optical music recognition is a key problem for coding western music sheets in the digital world. This problem has been addressed in several manners obtaining suitable results only when simple music constructs are processed. To this end, several different strategies have been followed, to pass from the simple music sheet image to a complete and consistent representation of music notation symbols (symbolic music notation or representation). Typically, image processing, pattern recognition and symbolic reconstruction are the technologies that have to be considered and applied in several manners the architecture of the so called OMR (Optical Music Recognition) systems. In this chapter, the O3MR (Object Oriented Optical Music Recognition) system is presented. It allows producing from the image of a music sheet the symbolic representation and save it in XML format (WEDELMUSIC XML and MUSICXML). The algorithms used in this process are those of the image processing, image segmentation, neural network pattern recognition, and symbolic reconstruction and reasoning. Most of the solutions can be applied in other field of image understanding. The development of the O3MR solution with all its algorithms has been partially supported by the European Commission, in the IMUTUS Research and Development project, while the related music notation editor has been partially funded by the research and development WEDELMUSIC project of the European Commission. The paper also includes a methodology for the assessment of other OMR systems. The set of metrics proposed has been used to assess the quality of results produce by the O3MR with respect the best OMR on market.},

Computers must process diagrams both as images (marks on paper) and as information. A diagram recognizer translates from image to information and a diagram generator translates from information to image. Current technology for diagram generation is ahead of the technology for diagram recognition. Diagram generators have extensive knowledge of notational conventions which relate to readability and aesthetics, whereas current diagram recognizers focus on the hard constraints of the notation. To create a recognizer capable of exploiting layout information, it is expedient to reuse the expertise in existing diagram generators. In particular, we discuss the use of Lime (our editor and generator for music notation) to proofread and correct the raw output of MIDIScan (a third-party commercial recognizer for music notation). Over the past several years, this combination of software has been distributed to thousands of users.},

  abstract  = {The digitization of printed music scores through the process of optical music recognition is imperfect. In polyphonic scores, with two or more simultaneous voices, errors of duration or position can lead to badly aligned and inharmonious digital transcriptions. We adapt biological sequence analysis tools as a post-processing step to correct the alignment of voices. Our multiple sequence alignment approach works on multiple musical dimensions and we investigate the contribution of each dimension to the correct alignment. Structural information, such musical phrase boundaries, is of major importance; therefore, we propose the use of the popular bioinformatics aligner Mafft which can incorporate such information while being robust to temporal noise. Our experiments show that a harmony-aware Mafft outperforms sophisticated, multidimensional alignment approaches and can achieve near-perfect polyphony reconstruction.},

  abstract  = {Digitalizing sheet music using Optical Music Recognition ({OMR}) is error-prone, especially when using noisy images created from scanned prints. Inspired by {DNA}-sequence alignment, we devise a method to use multiple sequence alignment to automatically compare output from multiple third party{OMR}tools and perform automatic error-correction of pitch and duration of notes. We perform tests on a corpus of 49 one-page scores of varying quality. Our method on average reduces the amount of errors from an ensemble of 4 commercial {OMR} tools. The method achieves, on average, fewer errors than each recognizer by itself, but statistical tests show that it is sig- nificantly better than only 2 of the 4 commercial recogniz- ers. The results suggest that recognizers may be improved somewhat by sequence alignment and voting, but that more elaborate methods may be needed to obtain substantial im- provements.

In music informatics, the Music Information Retrieval Exchange (MIREX), with its annual tests and meetings held during the ISMIR conference, is a close analog to TREC; but MIREX has never had an OMR track or a collection of music such a track could employ. We describe why the absence of an OMR testbed is a problem and how this problem may be mitigated. To aid in the establishment of a standard testbed, we provide (1) a set of definitions for the complexity of music notation; (2) a set of performance metrics for OMR tools that gauge score complexity and graphical quality; and (3) a small corpus of music for use as a baseline for a proper OMR testbed.},

However, the development of such systems is still largely unexplored. Some studies have been carried out but the use of particular little datasets has led to avoid objective comparisons between different approaches. To solve this situation, this work presents the Handwritten Online Musical Symbols (HOMUS) dataset, which consists of 15200 samples of 32 types of musical symbols from 100 different musicians. Several alternatives of recognition for the two modalities -online, using the strokes drawn by the pen, and offline, using the image generated after drawing the symbol- are also presented. Some experiments are included aimed to draw main conclusions about the recognition of these data. It is expected that this work can establish a binding point in the field of recognition of online handwritten music notation and serve as a baseline for future developments.},

  abstract  = {This work presents a novel approach to tackle the music staff removal.
	This task is devoted to removing the staff lines from an image of
	a music score while maintaining the symbol information. It represents
	a key step in the performance of most optical music recognition systems.
	In the literature, staff removal is usually solved by means of image
	processing procedures based on the intrinsics of music scores. However,
	we propose to model the problem as a supervised learning classification
	task. Surprisingly, although there is a strong background and a vast
	amount of research concerning machine learning, the classification
	approach has remained unexplored for this purpose. In this context,
	each foreground pixel is labelled as either staff or symbol. We use
	pairs of scores with and without staff lines to train classification
	algorithms. We test our proposal with several well-known classification
	techniques. Moreover, in our experiments no attempt of tuning the
	classification algorithms has been made, but the parameters were
	set to the default setting provided by the classification software
	libraries. The aim of this choice is to show that, even with this
	straightforward procedure, results are competitive with state-of-the-art
	algorithms. In addition, we also discuss several advantages of this
	approach for which conventional methods are not applicable such as
	its high adaptability to any type of music score.},

  abstract = {Staff-line removal is an important preprocessing stage for most optical music recognition systems. Common procedures to solve this task involve image processing techniques. In contrast to these traditional methods based on hand-engineered transformations, the problem can also be approached as a classification task in which each pixel is labeled as either staff or symbol, so that only those that belong to symbols are kept in the image. In order to perform this classification, we propose the use of convolutional neural networks, which have demonstrated an outstanding performance in image retrieval tasks. The initial features of each pixel consist of a square patch from the input image centered at that pixel. The proposed network is trained by using a dataset which contains pairs of scores with and without the staff lines. Our results in both binary and grayscale images show that the proposed technique is very accurate, outperforming both other classifiers and the state-of-the-art strategies considered. In addition, several advantages of the presented methodology with respect to traditional procedures proposed so far are discussed.},

In this paper we discuss the Handwritten Music Recognition problem, which refers to the development of automatic transcription systems for musical manuscripts. We focus on mensural notation, one of the most widespread varieties of Western classical music. For that, we present a labeled corpus containing 576 staves, along with a baseline recognition system based on a combination of hidden Markov models and N-gram language models. The baseline error obtained at symbol level is about 40 % which, given the difficulty of the task, can be considered a good starting point for future developments.

For the evaluation we consider four datasets containing different configurations and notation styles, along with a number of network models, different image preprocessing techniques and several supervised learning classifiers.

  abstract  = {Content within musical documents not only contains music symbol but also include different elements such as staff lines, text, or frontispieces. Before attempting to automatically recognize components in these layers, it is necessary to perform an analysis of the musical documents in order to detect and classify each of these constituent parts. The obstacle for this analysis is the high heterogeneity amongst music collections, especially with ancient documents, which makes it difficult to devise methods that can be generalizable to a broader range of sources. In this paper we propose a data-driven document analysis framework based on machine learning that focuses on classifying regions of interest at pixel level. For that, we make use of Convolutional Neural Networks trained to infer the category of each pixel. The main advantage of this approach is that it can be applied regardless of the type of document provided, as long as training data is available. Since this work represents first efforts in that direction, our experimentation focuses on reporting a baseline classification using our framework. The experiments show promising performance, achieving an accuracy around 90% in two corpora of old music documents.},

The series of strokes received as input is mapped onto a stochastic representation, which is combined with a formal language that describes musical symbols in terms of stroke primitives. Then, a Probabilistic Finite-State Automaton is obtained, which defines probabilities over the set of musical sequences. This model is eventually crossed with a semantic language to avoid sequences that does not make musical sense. Finally, a decoding strategy is applied in order to output a hypothesis about the musical sequence actually written. Comprehensive experimentation with several decoding algorithms, stroke similarity measures and probability density estimators are tested and evaluated following different metrics of interest. Results found have shown the goodness of the proposed model, obtaining competitive performances in all metrics and scenarios considered.},

Despite the efforts made so far, there are hardly any complete solutions to the problem. In this work, we study the use of neural networks that work in an end-to-end manner. This is achieved by using a neural model that combines the capabilities of convolutional neural networks, which work on the input image, and recurrent neural networks, which deal with the sequential nature of the problem. Thanks to the use of the the so-called Connectionist Temporal Classification loss function, these models can be directly trained from input images accompanied by their corresponding transcripts into music symbol sequences. We also present the Printed Music Scores dataset, containing more than 80,000 monodic single-staff real scores in common western notation, that is used to train and evaluate the neural approach. In our experiments, it is demonstrated that this formulation can be carried out successfully. Additionally, we study several considerations about the codification of the output musical sequences, the convergence and scalability of the neural models, as well as the ability of this approach to locate symbols in the input score.},

The use of Deep Neural Networks techniques has reported outstanding results in many areas related to computer vision. Consequently, in this paper, we study the so-called Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for performing the automatic document processing of music score images. This process is focused on layering the image into its constituent parts (namely, background, staff lines, music notes, and text) by training a classifier with examples of these parts. A comprehensive experimentation in terms of the configuration of the networks was carried out, which illustrates interesting results as regards to both the efficiency and effectiveness of these models. In addition, a cross-manuscript adaptation experiment was presented in which the networks are evaluated on a different manuscript from the one they were trained. The results suggest that the CNN is capable of adapting its knowledge, and so starting from a pre-trained CNN reduces (or eliminates) the need for new labeled data.},

	(LA) is needed. This LA must provide not only the locations of the
	different image regions, but also adequate region labels to distinguish
	between different region types such as staff, lyric, etc. To this
	end, we adapt a stochastic framework for LA based on Hidden Markov
	Models that we had previously introduced for detection and classification
	of text lines in typical handwritten text images. The proposed approach
	takes a scanned music score image as input and, after basic preprocessing,
	simultaneously performs region detection and region classification
	in an integrated way. To assess this statistical LA approach several
	experiments were carried out on a representative sample of a historical
	music archive, under different difficulty settings. The results show
	that our approach is able to tackle these structured documents providing
	good results not only for region detection but also for classification
	of the different regions.},

The problems of segmentation involved in isolating the musical symbols from the word-underlay and decorative graphics are compounded by the poor quality of the originals which present a significant challenge to any recognition system.

The next substantial project, which is described here, has begun with a pilot study with a view to conversion of the 104 Haydn symphonies from a printed edition into machine- readable form. The score recognition system is based on a structural decomposition approach which provides advantages in terms of speed and tolerance of significant variations in font, scale, rotation and noise. Inevitably, some editing of the output data files is required, partially due to the limited vocabulary of symbols supported by the system and their permitted superimpositions. However, the possibility of automatically processing the bulk of the contents of over 600 pages of orchestral score in less than a day of compute time makes the conversion task manageable. The influence that this undertaking is having on the future direction of system development also is discussed.},

This paper describes and compares different methods to restore images of ancient music documents degraded over time. Six different methods were tested, including global and adaptive thresholding, color clustering and edge detection. In this paper we conclude that those based on the Sauvola's thresholding algorithm are the better suited for our proposed goal of ancient music restoration.},

	Notation (GCN). First, it introduces the background of Kunqu Opera
	and GCN. Kunqu Opera is one of the oldest forms of musical activity,
	spanning the sixteenth to eighteenth centuries, and GCN has been
	the most popular notation for recording musical works in China since
	the seventh century. Many Kunqu Operas that use GCN are available
	as original manuscripts or photocopies, and transforming these versions
	into a machine-readable format is a pressing need. The OMR system
	comprises six stages: image pre-processing, segmentation, feature
	extraction, symbol recognition, musical semantics, and musical instrument
	digital interface (MIDI) representation. This paper focuses on the
	symbol recognition stage and obtains the musical information with
	Bayesian, genetic algorithm, and K-nearest neighbor classifiers.
	The experimental results indicate that symbol recognition for Kunqu
	Opera's handwritten musical scores is effective. This work will help
	to preserve and popularize Chinese cultural heritage and to store
	Kunqu Opera scores in a machine-readable format, thereby ensuring
	the possibility of spreading and performing original Kunqu Opera

The software we describe, which uses computationally inexpensive methods, is designed to analyze a music score, previously read by a flat bed scanner, and to extract the musical information that it contains. The paper discusses the methods used to recognize the musical text: these involve sampling the image at strategic points and using this information to estimate the musical symbol. It then discusses some hard problems that have been encountered during the course of the research; for example the recognition of chords and note clusters. It also reports on the progress that has been made in solving these problems and concludes with a discussion of work that needs to be undertaken over the next five years in order to transform this research prototype into a commercial product.},

The approach presented in this paper is based on a general algorithmic framework for searching complex patterns of objects in large databases.

Indeed there exists an important set of rules for musical notation, but current systems do not fully use them. We propose a new solution using a grammar to guide the segmentation of the graphical ob jects and their recognition. The grammar is essentially a description of the relations (relative position and size, adjacency, etc) between the graphical ob jects. Inspired by Denite Clause Grammar techniques, the grammar can be directly implemented in Prolog, a higher-order dialect of Prolog. Moreover, the translation from the grammar into Prolog code can be done automatically. Our approach is justied by the rst encouraging results obtained with a prototype for music score recognition.},

Musical notation is governed by a substantial set of rules, but current systems fail to use them adequately. In complex scores, existing systems cannot overcome the well-known segmentation problems of document analysis, due mainly to the high density of music information. This paper proposes a new method of recognition which uses a grammar in order to formalize the syntactic rules and represent the context. However, where objects touch, there is a discrepancy between the way the existing knowledge (grammar) will describe an object and the way it is recognized, since touching objects have to be segmented first. Following a description of the grammar, this paper shall go on to propose the use of an operator to modify the way the grammar parses the image so that the system can deal with certain touching objects (e.g. where an accidental touches a notehead).},

	music score and converting it to a format that is understood by computers.
	This process involves detecting all musical elements present in the
	music score in such a way that the score can be represented digitally.
	For example, the score could be recognised and played back through
	the computer speakers. Much research has been carried out in this
	area and several approaches to performing OMR have been suggested.
	A more recent approach involves segmenting the image using a neural
	network to recognise the segmented symbols from which the score can
	be reconstructed. This project will survey the different techniques
	that have been used to perform OMR on printed music scores and an
	application by the name of OpenOMR will be developed. One of the
	aims is to create an open source project in which developers in the
	open source community will be able to contribute their ideas in order
	to enhance this application and progress the research in the OMR

	The developed approach for such classification application is called
	GMM-Formant. Since humming and voiced speech sounds cause periodic
	vibrations of the vocal folds and then the corresponding motion of
	the lip, the proposed GMM-Formant firstly operates to acquire the
	required formant information. Formant information is important acoustic
	feature data for recognition classification. The proposed GMM-Formant
	method then uses linear interpolation for combining GMM likelihood
	estimates and formant evaluation results appropriately. GMM-Formant
	will effectively adjust the estimated formant feature evaluation
	outcomes by referring to certain degree of the likelihood score derived
	from GMM calculations. The superiority and effectiveness of presented
	GMM-Formant are demonstrated by a series of experiments on musical
	genre classification of the singer.},

	fast processing to recognize and play live the notes in images captured
	from sheet music. However, most techniques that have been developed
	thus far have focused on playing back instrumental music and have
	ignored the importance of lyric extraction, which is time consuming
	and affects the accuracy of the OMR tools. The text of the lyrics
	adds complexity to the page layout, particularly when lyrics touch
	or overlap musical symbols, in which case it is very difficult to
	separate them from each other. In addition, the distortion that appears
	in captured musical images makes the lyric lines curved or skewed,
	making the lyric extraction problem more complicated. This paper
	proposes a new approach in which lyrics are detected and extracted
	quickly and effectively. First, in order to resolve the distortion
	problem, the image is undistorted by a method using information of
	stave lines and bar lines. Then, through the use of a frequency count
	method and heuristic rules based on projection, the lyric areas are
	extracted, the cases where symbols touch the lyrics are resolved,
	and most of the information from the musical notation is kept even
	when the lyrics and music notes are overlapping. Our algorithm demonstrated
	a short processing time and remarkable accuracy on two test datasets
	of images of printed Korean musical scores: The first set included
	three hundred scanned musical images; the second set had two hundred

This paper introduces the Build-Weed-Incorporate programming style for graph grammars and shows its application in determining the meaning of complex diagrams, where the interaction among physically distant symbols is semantically important. Diagram recognition can be divided into two stages: symbol recognition and high-level recognition. Symbol recognition has been studied extensively in the literature. In this work we assume the existence of a symbol recognizer and use a graph grammar to assemble the diagram's information content from the symbols and their spatial relationships. The Build-Weed-Incorporate approach is demonstrated by a detailed discussion of a graph grammar for high-level recognition of music notation.},

Once the primitives of the image are recognized, depending on the application, many types of analyses can take place. It is likely that associated with each object or primitive is a set of possible interpretations, herein referred to as the label set. The low-level recognizer may associate a probability with each label in the label set. We can use the constraints of the application domain to reduce the ambiguity in the object's identity. This process is variously termed constraint satisfaction, labeling, or relaxation. In this paper, we focus on the discrete form of relaxation. Our contribution lies in the development of a graph-rewriting approach which does not assume the degree of localness is high. We apply our approach to the recognition of music notation, where non-local interactions between primitives must be used in order to reduce ambiguity in the identity of the primitives. We use graph-rewriting rules to express not only binary constraints, but also higher-order notational constraints.},

  abstract = {In image analysis, recognition of the primitives plays an important role. Subsequent analysis is used to interpret the arrangement of primitives. This subsequent analysis must make allowance for errors or ambiguities in the recognition of primitives. In this paper, we assume that the primitive recognizer produces a set of possible interpretations for each primitive. To reduce this primitive-recognition ambiguity, we use contextual information in the image, and apply constraints from the image domain. This process is variously termed constraint satisfaction, labeling or discrete relaxation. Existing methods for discrete relaxation are limited in that they assume a priori knowledge of the neighborhood model: before relaxation begins, the system is told (or can determine) which sets of primitives are related by constraints. These methods do not apply to image domains in which complex analysis is necessary to determine which primitives are related by constraints. For example, in music notation, we must recognize which notes belong to one measure, before it is possible to apply the constraint that the number of beats in the measure should match the time signature. Such constraints can be handled by our graph-rewriting paradigm for discrete relaxation: here neighborhood-model construction is interleaved with constraint-application. In applying this approach to the recognition of simple music notation, we use approximately 180 graph-rewriting rules to express notational constraints and semantic-interpretation rules far music notation. The graph rewriting rules express both binary and higher-order notational constraints. As image-interpretation proceeds, increasingly abstract levels of interpretation are assigned to (groups of) primitives. This allows application of higher-level constraints, which can be formulated only after partial interpretation of the image.},

Optical Music Recognition (OMR) is the automatic recognition of a scanned page of printed music. All such systems are evaluated by their rate of successful recognition; therefore a reliable OMR program should be able to detect and eventually correct its own recognition errors. Since we are interested in dealing with polyphonic music, some additional complexity is introduced as several concurrent voices and simultaneous musical events may occur. In RIEM, the OMR system we are developing, when events are inaccurately recognized they will generate inconsistencies in the process of voice separation. Furthermore if some events are missing a consistent voice separation may not even be possible.},

After introducing our work with modern musical scores (where projections and Hough Transform are effectively used), an approach to deal with ancient handwritten scores is exposed. The recognition of such these old scores is more difficult due to paper degradation and the lack of a standard in musical notation. Our method has been tested with several scores of 19th century with high performance rates.},

In this paper we present a system for writer identification in old handwritten music scores. Even though an important amount of compositions contains handwritten text in the music scores, the aim of our work is to use only music notation to determine the author. The steps of the system proposed are the following. First of all, the music sheet is preprocessed and normalized for obtaining a single binarized music line, without the staff lines. Afterwards, 100 features are extracted for every music line, which are subsequently used in a k-NN classifier that compares every feature vector with prototypes stored in a database. By applying feature selection and extraction methods on the original feature set, the performance is increased. The proposed method has been tested on a database of old music scores from the 17th to 19th centuries, achieving a recognition rate of about 95%.},

In this paper, we present a novel procedure for mapping scanned pages of sheet music to a given collection of audio recordings by identifying musically corresponding audio clips. To this end, both the scanned images as well as the audio recordings are first transformed into a common feature representation using optical music recognition ({OMR}) and methods from digital signal processing, respectively. Based on this common representation, a direct comparison of the two different types of data is facilitated. This allows for a search of scan-based queries in the audio collection. We report on systematic experiments conducted on the corpus of Beethoven’s piano sonatas showing that our mapping procedure works with high precision across the two types of music data in the case that there are no severe {OMR} errors. The proposed mapping procedure is relevant in a real-world application scenario at the Bavarian State Library for automatically identifying and annotating scanned sheet music by means of already available annotated audio material.},

This classification is based on the k-nearest neighbor method using a subset of the database that contains features of symbols classified in previous recognition sessions. Output of the recognizer is corrected by a musically trained human operator using a music notation editor. The editor provides both visual and high-quality audio feedback of the output. Editorial corrections made by the operator are passed to the learner which then adds the newly acquired data to the database. The learner's main task, however, involves selecting a subset of the database and reweighing the importance of the features to improve accuracy and speed for subsequent sessions.

Although similar to optical character recognition (OCR                    optical character recognition (OCR)                  ), the process and procedures of OMR diverge due to the fundamental differences between text and music notation, such as the two-dimensional nature of the notation system and the overlay of music symbols on top of staff lines. The OMR process can be described as a sequence of steps, with techniques adapted from disciplines including image processing, machine learning, grammars, and notation encoding. The sequence and specific techniques used can differ depending on the condition of the image, the type of notation, and the desired output.},

  abstract = {Abstract Staff-line removal is an important preprocessing stage as regards most Optical Music Recognition systems. The common procedures employed to carry out this task involve image processing techniques. In contrast to these traditional methods, which are based on hand-engineered transformations, the problem can also be approached from a machine learning point of view if representative examples of the task are provided. We propose doing this through the use of a new approach involving auto-encoders, which select the appropriate features of an input feature set (Selectional Auto-Encoders). Within the context of the problem at hand, the model is trained to select those pixels of a given image that belong to a musical symbol, thus removing the lines of the staves. Our results show that the proposed technique is quite competitive and significantly outperforms the other state-of-art strategies considered, particularly when dealing with grayscale input images. },

Furthermore, we analyze the effect of two improvements of the representation: a Bhattacharyya embedding, which improves the results at virtually no extra cost, and a Fisher Vector representation that very significantly improves the results at the cost of a more complex and costly representation. Experimental evaluation shows results more than 20 points above the state-of-the-art in a new, challenging dataset.},

The MUSCIMarker tool used for creating the MUSCIMA++ dataset for Optical Music Recognition (OMR) led to efficient use of annotation resources, and it provides enough flexibility to be applicable to creating datasets for other graphics recognition tasks where the ground truth can be represented similarly. First, we describe the MUSCIMA++ ground truth to define the range of tasks for which using MUSCIMarker to annotate ground truth is applicable. We then describe the MUSCIMarker tool itself, discuss its strong and weak points, and share practical experience with the tool from creating the MUSCIMA++ dataset.},

  abstract  = {Optical Music Recognition (OMR) promises to make accessible the content of large amounts of musical documents, an important component of cultural heritage. However, the field does not have an adequate dataset and ground truth for benchmarking OMR systems, which has been a major obstacle to measurable progress. Furthermore, machine learning methods for OMR require training data. We design and collect MUSCIMA++, a new dataset for OMR. Ground truth in MUSCIMA++ is a notation graph, which our analysis shows to be a necessary and sufficient representation of music notation. Building on the CVC-MUSCIMA dataset for staffline removal, the MUSCIMA++ dataset v1.0 consists of 140 pages of handwritten music, with 91254 manually annotated notation symbols and 82247 explicitly marked relationships between symbol pairs. The dataset allows training and directly evaluating models for symbol classification, symbol localization, and notation graph assembly, and indirectly musical content extraction, both in isolation and jointly. Open-source tools are provided for manipulating the dataset, visualizing the data and annotating further, and the data is made available under an open license.},

  abstract  = {Optical Music Recognition (OMR) promises to make large collections of sheet music searchable by their musical content. It would open up novel ways of accessing the vast amount of written music that has never been recorded before. For a long time, OMR was not living up to that promise, as its performance was simply not good enough, especially on handwritten music or under non-ideal image conditions. However, OMR has recently seen a number of improvements, mainly due to the advances in machine learning. In this work, we take an OMR system based on the traditional pipeline and an end-to-end system, which represent the current state of the art, and illustrate in proof-of-concept experiments their applicability in retrieval settings. We also provide an example of a musicological study that can be replicated with OMR outputs at much lower costs. Taken together, this indicates that in some settings, current OMR can be used as a general tool for enriching digital libraries.},

  abstract  = {The paper deals with optical music recognition (OMR) as a process of structured data processing applied to music notation. Granularity of OMR in both its aspects: data representation and data processing is especially emphasised in the paper. OMR is a challenge in intelligent computing technologies, especially in such fields as pattern recognition and knowledge representation and processing. Music notation is a language allowing for communication in music, one of most sophisticated field of human activity, and has a high level of complexity itself. On the one hand, music notation symbols vary in size and have complex shapes; they often touch and overlap each other. This feature makes the recognition of music symbols a very difficult and complicated task. On the other hand, music notation is a two dimensional language in which importance of geometrical and logical relations between its symbols may be compared to the importance of the symbols alone. Due to complexity of music nature and music notation, music representation, necessary to store and reuse recognised information, is also the key issue in music notation recognition and music processing. Both: the data representation and the data processing used in OMR is highly structured, granular rather than numeric. OMR technology fits paradigm of granular computing},

A rule-based music interpretation system is being developed that generates sophisticated performance from a printed music score. The authors describe the function of learning how to play music, which is the most important process in music interpretation. The target to be learned is expression rules and grouping strategy: expression rules are used to convert dynamic marks and motives into concrete performance data, and grouping strategy is used to extract motives from sequences of notes. They are learned from a given virtuoso performance. The delicate control of attack timing and of the duration and strength of the notes is extracted by the music transcription function. The performance rules are learned by investigating how the same or similar musical primitives are played in a performance. As for the grouping strategy, the system analyzes how the player grouped music and registers dominant note sequences to extract motives.<<ETX>>},

	However, chords are not considered in these systems yet they play

	can deal with separation and recognition of chords in music score
	images. Separation is necessary because the chords can be touched,
	overlapped or/and broken due to noise and other reasons. By considering
	these problems, we propose top-down based separation using domain
	information and characteristics of the chords. To handle recognition,
	we propose a modified zoning method with k-nearest neighbor classifier.
	Also, we analyzed several classifiers with different features to
	see which method is reliable for the chord recognition. Since this
	topic is not considered with special focus before, there is not a
	standard benchmark to evaluate performance of the algorithm. Thus,
	we introduce a new dataset, namely OMR-ChSR6306, which includes a
	wide range of chords such as single chords, touched chords, and overlapped
	chords. Experiments on the proposed dataset demonstrate that our
	algorithm can separate and recognize the chords, with 100% separation

The music message language is defined and several important aspects of message imaging are discussed. Aspects of music notation that appear problematic for a finite-state representation are identified. Finally, an example of music image decoding and resynthesis using the model is presented.

In particular, our system offers high quality audio playback with time-synchronous display of the digitized sheet music. Furthermore, our system allows a user to select regions within the scanned pages of a musical score in order to search for musically similar sections within the audio documents.

Many have a bias against using computers to store, edit and retrieve music, and prefer to work in the paper domain rather than using digital documents, despite the flexibility and powerful retrieval opportunities available. In this paper we propose a model of operation that blurs the boundaries between the paper and digital domains, offering musicians the best of both worlds. A survey of musicians identifies the problems and potential of working with digital tools, and we propose a system using colour printing and scanning technology that simplifies the process of moving music documents between the two domains},

Firstly, we propose robust algorithms for extracting primitives (stems, noteheads and beams) based on Run-Length Encoding. Secondly, introduce the concept of interaction field to describe the relationship between primitives, and define six hierarchical categories for the structure of notes. Thirdly, propose an effective sequence to assemble the primitives into notes, guided by the mechanism of giving priority to the key structures. To evaluate the performance of those approaches,wepresent experimental results on real-life scores and comparisons with commercial systems. The results show our approaches can recognize notes with high-accuracy and powerful adaptability, especially for the complicated scores with high density of symbols.},

However, the recognition of non-typical fonts is still an unsolved issue. In this paper a model of a recognition system for unusual scores is presented. In the model described non-disruption symbols are used to generate a learning set that makes possible improved recognition as is presented on a real example of rests and accidentals recognition.

In our algorithm, the musical score-words are described as sequences of symbols generated from a universal codebook vocabulary of musical scores. Staff lines are removed first from musical documents using structural analysis of staff lines and symbol codebook vocabulary is created in offline. Next, using this symbol codebook the music symbol information in each document image is encoded. Given a query sequence of musical symbols in a musical score-line, the symbols in the query are searched in each of these encoded documents. Finally, a sub-string matching algorithm is applied to find query words. For codebook, two different feature extraction methods namely: Zernike Moments and 400 dimensional gradient features are tested and two unsupervised classifiers using SOM and K-Mean are evaluated. The results are compared with a baseline approach of DTW. The performance is measured on a collection of handwritten musical documents and results are promising.},

Recognizing musical score images requires an accurate segmentation stage to isolate symbols from staff lines. This symbols/staves segregation is achieved by the use of inscribed line (chord) information. This information, processed by a multilayer perceptron, allows an efficient segmentation in terms of the remaining connected components. Some of these components are then classified, using another network, according to a coding of their skeleton graph. Special attention is paid to the design of the networks: the architectures are adapted to the specificities of each task. Multilayer perceptrons are employed here together with other more classical image analysis techniques which are also presented. },

Music is presented in various formats to us like aural, visual and one more - written form of music that is known very less to us. In a way music dominates our life. System discussed in this paper inputs music score written for piano music using modern staff notations as image. Segmentation is carried out using hierarchical decomposition using thresholding along with stave lines of score sheet. Segmented symbols are recognized through an established artificial neural network based on boosting approach. Recognized symbols are represented in an admissible way. System is capable enough of addressing very complex cases and validation is done over 53 songs available at various global music scores resources. Segmentation algorithms achieve accuracy of 99.12% and segmented symbols are recognized with prompt accuracy of 92.38% through the help of PCA and AdaBoost.},

As a result, recognition rates of 85.78% and average recognition times of 5.19 ms/stroke were obtained for 6,999 test strokes of handwritten music symbols, respectively. The proposed HMM recognition rate is 2.4% higher than that achieved with the traditional method, and the processing time was 73% of that required by the traditional method.},

(1) We extract all regions which are considered as candidates of stems or heads. (2) To identify heads from the candidates, we use a three-layer neural network. (3) The weights for the network are learned by the back propagation method. In the learning, the network learns the spatial constraints between heads and surroundings rather than the shapes of heads.

As an experimental result, we obtained high recognition rates of 99.0{\%} and 99.2{\%} for stems and note heads, respectively. It took between 40 to 100 seconds to process a printed piano score on A4 sheet using a workstation. Therefore, our system can analyze it at least 10 times as fast as manual methods},

  abstract = {Music representation utilizes a fairly rich repertoire of symbols. These symbols appear on a score sheet with relatively little shape distortion, differing from the prototype symbol shapes mainly by a positional translation and scale change. The prototype system we describe in this article is aimed at recognizing printed music notation from digitized music score images. The recognition system is composed of two parts: a low-level vision module that uses morphological algorithms for symbol detection and a high-level module that utilizes prior knowledge of music notation to reason about spatial positions and spatial sequences of these symbols. The high-level module also employs verification procedures to check the veracity of the output of the morphological symbol recognizer. The system produces an ASCII representation of music scores that can be input to a music-editing system. Mathematical morphology provides us the theory and the tools to analyze shapes. This characteristic of mathematical morphology lends itself well to analyzing and subsequently recognizing music scores that are rich in well-defined musical symbols. Since morphological operations can be efficiently implemented in machine vision systems that have special hardware support, the recognition task can be performed in near real-time. The system achieves accuracy in excess of 95{\%} on the sample scores processed so far with a peak accuracy of 99.7{\%} for the quarter and eighth notes, demonstrating the efficacy of morphological techniques for shape extraction.},

Many heuristic algorithms have been proposed for staff removal and recently a competition was organized in the 2013 ICDAR/GREC conference. Music score images are often subject to different deformations and variations, and existing algorithms do not work well for all cases. We investigate the application of a machine learning based method for the staff removal problem. The method consists in learning multiple image operators from training input-output pairs of images and then combining the results of these operators. Each operator is based on local information provided by a neighborhood window, which is usually manually chosen based on the content of the images. We propose a feature selection based approach for automatically defining the windows and also for combining the operators. The performance of the proposed method is superior to several existing methods and is comparable to the best method in the competition. © 2014 IEEE.},

It can not only generate sound but is also able to perform time consuming and repetitive tasks, such as transposition and part extraction, with speed and accuracy. However, a score must be represented in a machine readable format before any operation can be carried out. Current input methods, such as using an electronic keyboard, are time consuming and require human intervention. Optical music recognition (OMR) provides an interesting, efficient and automatic method to transform paper-based music scores into a machine representation. The authors outline the techniques for pre-processing and discuss the heuristic and musical rules employed to enhance recognition. A spin-off application that makes use of the intermediate results to enhance stave lines is also presented. The authors concentrate on the techniques used for time-signature detection, discuss the application of frequently-found rhythmical patterns to clarify the results of OMR, and propose possible enhancements using such knowledge. They believe that domain-knowledge enhancement is essential for complex document analysis and recognition. Other possible areas of development include melodic, harmonic and stylistic analysis to improve recognition results further.},

In this paper we identify some of the problems peculiar to musical scores, and propose an approach which succeeds in a wide range of non-trivial cases. The composer customarily proceeds by writing notes, then stems, beams, ties and slurs — we have inverted this approach by segmenting and then subsegmenting scores to recapture the component parts of symbols. In this paper, we concentrate on the strategy of recognizing sub-segmented primitives, and the reassembly process which reconstructs low level graphical primitives back to musical symbols. The sub-segmentation process proves to be worthwhile, since many primitives complement each other and high level musical theory can be employed to enhance the recognition process.},

There are several researches in staff line detection and removal which provide good results with printed scores. However, in case of handwritten music scores, detecting staff lines still has problems due to the diversity of musical symbol shape, line curvature and disconnection. In this paper, we present a novel line fitting method for detecting the staff line in handwritten music score images. Our method first starts with the estimation of staff line height and staff space height. Then the staff segments are selected. Based on these staff candidates, we construct a line with the orientation of the staff segment and gradually fit it to the real lines. The staff line is then removed and the process is continuing until no line is detected. To show the effectiveness of our proposed method with different types of handwritten music score, images from the ICDAR/GREC 2013 dataset are tested. The experiment results show the advantages of our algorithm comparing with the previous approaches. Copyright 2014 ACM.},

The proposed methods were evaluated on a dataset containing over 1000 clefs extracted from J.S. Bachs manuscripts. The results show more than 70% accuracy for dating J.S.

be performed at high rates of confidence (>98%) which is

However, so far, each such proposal has been based on a specific dataset and different evaluation criteria, which made it difficult to quantify the new deep learning-based state-of-the-art and assess the relative merits of these detection models on music scores. In this paper, a baseline for general detection of musical symbols with deep learning is presented. We consider three datasets of heterogeneous typology but with the same annotation format, three neural models of different nature, and establish their performance in terms of a common evaluation standard. The experimental results confirm that the direct music object detection with deep learning is indeed promising, but at the same time illustrates some of the domain-specific shortcomings of the general detectors. A qualitative comparison then suggests avenues for OMR improvement, based both on properties of the detection model and how the datasets are defined. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that competing music object detection systems from the machine learning paradigm are directly compared to each other. We hope that this work will serve as a reference to measure the progress of future developments of OMR in music object detection.},

  abstract  = {Large quantities of scanned music are now available in public digital music libraries. However, the information in such sources is represented as pixel data in images rather than symbolic information about the notes of a piece of music, and therefore it is opaque to musically meaningful computational processes (e.g., to search for a particular melodic pattern). Optical Music Recognition (Optical Character Recognition for music) holds out the prospect of a solution to this issue and allowing access to very large quantities of musical information in digital libraries. Despite the efforts made by the different commercial OMR developers to improve the accuracy of their systems, mistakes in the output are currently too frequent to make OMR a practical tool for bulk processing.

One possibility for improving the accuracy of OMR is to use multiple recognisers and combine the results to achieve an output better than each of them individually. The general process presented here can be divided into three subtasks, S1, S2, and S3. S1 is focused in the correction of rhythmical errors at bar level, counting the errors of the different OMR outputs, establish a ranking of the results, and make a pairwise alignment to select the best measures. S2 is based on the alignment and voting of individual symbols. For this task we have implemented a conversion of the most important symbols to a simple grammar. Finally, S3 improves the output of S2 by comparing and adding symbols from S1 and detecting gaps through the alignment of wrong measures.

The process described in this paper is part of our "Big Data Approach" where a large amount of data is available in music score libraries, such as the International Music Score Library Project (IMSLP), for the purpose of Music Information Retrieval (MIR).},

  abstract = {A new algorithm for segmenting documents into regions containing musical
	scores and text is proposed. Such segmentation is a required step
	prior to applying optical character recognition and optical music
	recognition on scanned pages that contain both music notation and
	text. Our segmentation technique is based on the bag-of-visual-words
	representation followed by random block voting (RBV) in order to
	detect the bounding boxes containing the musical score and text within
	a document image. The RBV procedure consists of extracting a fixed
	number of blocks whose position and size are sampled from a discrete
	uniform distribution that ``over''-covers the input image. Each block
	is automatically classified as either coming from musical score or
	text and votes with a particular posterior probability of classification
	in its spatial domain. An initial coarse segmentation is obtained
	by summarizing all the votes in a single image. Subsequently, the
	final segmentation is obtained by subdividing the image in microblocks
	and classifying them using a N-nearest neighbor classifier which
	is trained using the coarse segmentation. We demonstrate the potential
	of the proposed method by experiments on two different datasets.
	One is on a challenging dataset of images collected and artificially
	combined and manipulated for this project. The other is a music dataset
	obtained by the scanning of two music books. The results are reported
	using precision/recall metrics of the overlapping area with respect
	to the ground truth. The proposed system achieves an overall averaged
	F-measure of 85 {\%}. The complete source code package and associated
	data are available at https://github.com/fpeder/mscr under the FreeBSD

Most of existing approaches for OMR (optical music recognition) removes staff lines before symbols are detected, therefore the symbols can get damaged easily. Another method recognizes symbols without staff line removal but all of them have a low accuracy rate and high processing time for recognizing symbols. In this paper, none staff removal and staff removal are suggested and these new methods are proposed to improve appreciation result of symbols. A lot of symbols are detected before deleted staff line as vertical lines, note head, pitch, beam, tail and then these staff lines are removed to identify other symbols using connected component. The proposed method is applied to the Samsung smart phone which embeds a high resolution camera. Experimental results show that the recognition rate is higher than existing methods and the computation time is reduced significantly.},

	In our proposal, after removing staff lines and extracting symbols,
	each music symbol is represented as a grid of identical M â- N cells,

	SVM classifiers. Through experiments, the authors find that the size
	of 10 â- 12 cells yields the highest precision value. Experimental
	results on the dataset consisting of 4929 music symbols taken from
	18 modern music sheets in the Synthetic Score Database show that

	accuracy up to 99.56%.},

This paper presents a novel binarization method based in the content knowledge of the image. The method only needs the estimation of the staffline thickness and the vertical distance between two stafflines. This information is extracted directly from the gray level music score. The proposed binarization procedure is experimentally compared with several state of the art methods.},

To reduce the number of recognition errors in the OMR process, we present an innovative approach to adapt the system dynamically, taking advantage of the human editing work that is part of any digitisation project. The corrected data are used to perform MAP adaptation, a machine-learning technique used previously in speech recognition and optical character recognition (OCR). Our experiments show that this technique can reduce editing costs by more than half.},

  abstract                = {Abstract: While the Optical Music Recognition (OMR) of printed and
	handwritten music scores in modern standard notation has been broadly
	studied, this is not the case for early music manuscripts. This is
	mainly due to the high variability in the sources introduced by their
	severe physical degradation, the lack of notation standards and,
	in the case of the scanned versions, by non-homogenous image-acquisition
	protocols. The volume of early musical manuscripts available is considerable,
	and therefore we believe that computational methods can be extremely
	useful in helping to preserve, share and analyse this information.
	This paper presents an approach to recognizing handwritten square
	musical notation in degraded western plainchant manuscripts from
	the XIVth to XVIth centuries. We propose the use of image processing
	techniques that behave robustly under high data variability and which
	do not require strong hypotheses regarding the condition of the sources.
	The main differences from traditional OMR approaches are our avoidance
	of the staff line removal stage and the use of grey-level images
	to perform primitive segmentation and feature extraction. We used
	136 images from the Digital Scriptorium repository (DS, 2007), from
	which we were able to extract over 90% of the staves and over 88%
	of all symbols present. For symbol classification, we used gradient-based
	features and SVM classifiers, obtaining over 90% precision and recall
	over eight basic symbol classes.},

A robust method based on finding regions where are only the staff lines, linking between them the staff lines pieces in these regions is used. After staff lines elimination, symbols are isolated and a representation called attributed graph is constructed for each symbol. Thinning, polygonalization, spurious segments cleaning, and segment fusion are performed. A first classification, separating all notes with black heads from others, is performed. To recognize notes with black heads (beamed group or quarter notes), a straightforward structural approach using this representation is sufficient and efficient in most cases. In the ambiguous cases (chord or black head linked to two stems), an ellipse matching method is used. To recognize half notes and bar lines, a structural method using the graph is used.<<ETX>>},

Preserving them entails their digitalization and consequent accessibility in a digital format easy-to-manage. The manual process to carry out this task is very time consuming and error prone. Optical music recognition (OMR) is a form of structured document image analysis where music symbols are isolated and identified so that the music can be conveniently processed. While OMR systems perform well on printed scores, current methods for reading handwritten musical scores by computers remain far from ideal. One of the fundamental stages of this process is the staff line detection. In this paper a new method for the automatic detection of music stave lines based on a shortest path approach is presented. Lines with some curvature, discontinuities, and inclination are robustly detected. The proposed algorithm behaves favourably when compared experimentally with well-established algorithms.},

  abstract = {Many musical works produced in the past are still currently available only as original manuscripts or as photocopies. The preservation of these works requires their digitalization and transformation into a machine-readable format. However, and despite the many research activities on optical music recognition (OMR), the results for handwritten musical scores are far from ideal. Each of the proposed methods lays the emphasis on different properties and therefore makes it difficult to evaluate the efficiency of a proposed method. We present in this article a comparative study of several recognition algorithms of music symbols. After a review of the most common procedures used in this context, their respective performances are compared using both real and synthetic scores. The database of scores was augmented with replicas of the existing patterns, transformed according to an elastic deformation technique. Such transformations aim to introduce invariances in the prediction with respect to the known variability in the symbols, particularly relevant on handwritten works. The following study and the adopted databases can constitute a reference scheme for any researcher who wants to confront a new OMR algorithm face to well-known ones.},

The efforts made to find robust symbol representations and learning methodologies have not found a similar quality in the learning of the dissimilarity concept. Simple Euclidean distances are often used to measure dissimilarity between different examples. However, such distances do not necessarily yield the best performance. In this paper, we propose to learn the best distance for the k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) classifier. The distance concept will be tuned both for the application domain and the adopted representation for the music symbols. The performance of the method is compared with the support vector machine (SVM) classifier using both real and synthetic music scores. The synthetic database includes four types of deformations inducing variability in the printed musical symbols which exist in handwritten music sheets. The work presented here can open new research paths towards a novel automatic musical symbols recognition module for handwritten scores.},

Its great significance derives from the ease with which we can then proceed with the extraction of musical symbols. All OMR tasks are usually achieved using binary images by setting thresholds that can be local or global. These techniques however, may remove relevant information of the music sheet and introduce artifacts which will degrade results in the later stages of the process. It arises therefore a need to create a method that reduces the loss of information due to the binarization. The baseline for the methodology proposed in this paper follows the shortest path algorithm proposed in [CardosoTPAMI08]. The concept of strong staff pixels (SSP's), which is a set of pixels with a high probability of belonging to a staff line, is proposed to guide the cost function. The SSP allows to overcome the results of the binary based detection and to generalize the binary framework to grayscale music scores. The proposed methodology achieves good results.},

This paper explores the alignment of music scores as a tool for automatically detecting the passages that contain such differences. Given the difficulties in the recognition of handwritten music scores, our goal is to align the music scores and at the same time, avoid the recognition of music elements as much as possible. After removing the staff lines, braces and ties, the bar lines are detected. Then, the bar units are described as a whole using the Blurred Shape Model. The bar units alignment is performed by using Dynamic Time Warping. The analysis of the alignment path is used to detect the variations in the music scores. The method has been evaluated on a subset of the CVC-MUSCIMA dataset, showing encouraging results. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.},

Pattern recognition is the major bottleneck holding up automation of this process. Human beings who know music can easily read a handwritten score, but without musical knowledge, even people cannot correctly perceive the markings in a handwritten score. This paper reports an experiment in which knowledge of music, a highly structured domain is applied to extract primitive musical features.

We only consider here classical monophonic music: we exclude any music written on several staves, but also any music that contains chords. In order to overcome recognition failures due to the lack of methods dealing with structural information, non-local rules and corrections, we propose a recognition approach integrating structural information in the form of relationships between symbols and of musical rules. Another contribution of this paper is to solve ambiguities by accounting for sources of imprecision and uncertainty, within the fuzzy set and possibility theory framework. We add to a single symbol analysis several rules for checking the consistency of hypotheses: graphical consistency (compatibility between accidental and note, between grace note and note, between note and augmentation dot, etc.), and syntactic consistency (accidentals, tonality, metric). All these rules are combined in order to lead to better decisions. Experimental results on 65 music sheets show that our approach leads to very good results, and is able to correct errors made by other approaches, such as the one of SmartScore.},

Thus, a recognition and segmentation method is designed, that allows dealing with common printing defects and numerous symbol interconnections. Then, musical rules are modeled and integrated, in order to make a consistent decision. This high-level interpretation step relies on the fuzzy sets and possibility framework, since it allows dealing with symbol variability, flexibility, and imprecision of music rules, and merging all these heterogeneous pieces of information. Other innovative features are the indication of potential errors and the possibility of applying learning procedures, in order to gain in robustness.

  abstract = {Writer identification from musical score documents is a challenging task due to its inherent problem of overlapping of musical symbols with staff-lines. Most of the existing works in the literature of writer identification in musical score documents were performed after a pre-processing stage of staff-lines removal. In this paper we propose a novel writer identification framework in musical score documents without removing staff-lines from the documents. In our approach, Hidden Markov Model (HMM) has been used to model the writing style of the writers without removing staff-lines. The sliding window features are extracted from musical score-lines and they are used to build writer specific HMM models. Given a query musical sheet, writer specific confidence for each musical line is returned by each writer specific model using a log-likelihood score. Next, a log-likelihood score in page level is computed by weighted combination of these scores from the corresponding line images of the page. A novel Factor Analysis-based feature selection technique is applied in sliding window features to reduce the noise appearing from staff-lines which proves efficiency in writer identification performance. In our framework we have also proposed a novel score-line detection approach in musical sheet using HMM. The experiment has been performed in CVC-MUSCIMA data set and the results obtained show that the proposed approach is efficient for score-line detection and writer identification without removing staff-lines. To get the idea of computation time of our method, detail analysis of execution time is also provided.},

  abstract  = {The area of Optical Music Recognition (OMR) has long been plagued by an inability to provide a definitive method for locating and identifying musical objects superimposed on musical stave lines. The first step in the process of recognising musical symbols in OMR has previously been to either remove the stave lines, or ignore them. Removing stave lines leads to many problems of fragmented and deformed musical symbols, or in the case of ignoring them, a lowered chance of recognition. Most OMR systems attempt to correct these deficiencies later on in the process through many varied approaches including bounding box analysis, k-nearest-neighbour (k-NN) and neural network (ANN) classification schemes. All of these have a level of success, but none have provided nearly the desired level of accuracy.

This paper aims to show that this removal of the stave lines before symbol recognition is not the only first step and may not be the best. Instead of removing stave lines, more should be added! This process is called ‘defacing’ since it adds stave lines to the score at a 1/2 stave line width, and actually overwrites the score - apparently complicating the recognition procedure. However, the addition of signal to the image means that subsequent symbol recognition is ‘normalised’ and a musical symbol will look the same whether it was above, below or on a stave line. As a result of this, a classification system trained with double stave lines should provide a higher level of accuracy than the traditional approaches of removing/ignoring the stave lines.},

In this paper, we investigate the problem of scene text recognition, which is among the most important and challenging tasks in image-based sequence recognition. A novel neural network architecture, which integrates feature extraction, sequence modeling and transcription into a unified framework, is proposed. Compared with previous systems for scene text recognition, the proposed architecture possesses four distinctive properties: (1) It is end-to-end trainable, in contrast to most of the existing algorithms whose components are separately trained and tuned. (2) It naturally handles sequences in arbitrary lengths, involving no character segmentation or horizontal scale normalization. (3) It is not confined to any predefined lexicon and achieves remarkable performances in both lexicon-free and lexicon-based scene text recognition tasks. (4) It generates an effective yet much smaller model, which is more practical for realworld application scenarios. The experiments on standard benchmarks, including the IIIT-5K, Street View Text and ICDAR datasets, demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm over the prior arts. Moreover, the proposed algorithm performs well in the task of image-based music score recognition, which evidently verifies the generality of it.},

One of the disadvantages of BP is that much time is required to train data sets. For example, when new data sets are added, all data sets have to be trained. Another disadvantage is that weighting values cannot be guaranteed as global optima after training them. It means that weighting values can fall down to local optimum solution. In this paper, we propose the new OMR method which combines the adaptive resonance theory (ART-1) with the genetic algorithms (GA). For reducing the training time, we use ART-1 which classifies several music symbols. It has another advantage to reduce the number of datasets, because classified symbols through ART-1 are used as input vectors of BP. And for guaranteeing the global optima in training data set, we use GA which is known as one of the best method for finding optimal solutions at complex problems.},

  abstract = {Optical Music Recognition (OMR) can be divided into three main phases: (i) staff line detection and removal. The goal of this phase is to detect and to remove staff lines from sheet music images. (ii) music symbol detection and segmentation. The propose of this phase is to detect the remaining musical symbols such as single symbols and group symbols, then segment the group symbols to single or primitive symbols after removing staff lines. (iii) musical symbols recognition. In this phase, recognition of musical symbols is the main objective. The method presented in this paper, covers all three phases. One advantage of the first phase of the proposed method is that it is robust to staff lines rotation and staff lines which have curvature in sheet music images. Moreover, the staff lines are removed accurately and quickly and also fewer details of the musical symbols are omitted. The proposed method in the first phase focuses on the hand-written documents databases which have been introduced in the CVC-MUSCIMA and ICDAR 2013. It has the lowest error rate among well-known methods and outperforms the state of the art in CVC-MUSCIMA database. In ICDAR 2013, the specificity measure of this method is 99.71{\%} which is the highest specificity among available methods. Also, in terms of accuracy, recall rate and f-measure is only slightly less than the best method. Therefor our method is comparable favorably to the existing methods. In the second phase, the symbols are divided into two categories, single and group. In the recognition phase, we use a pattern matching method to identify single symbols. For recognizing group symbols, a hierarchical method is proposed. The proposed method in the third phase has several advantages over the previous methods. It is quite robust to skewness of musical group symbols. Furthermore, it provides high accuracy in recognition of the symbols.},

Such an implementation entails significantly less computational effort than that required by classic OMR systems, without an observable compromise in the quality of the on-screen presentation of the MS. The identification of the music symbols of interest is performed via probabilistic neural networks (PNN's), which are trained on a small set of exemplars from the MS itself.

At the beginning, we detect the locations of bar-lines on each staff and segment it into sub-areas which can be rectified into undistorted shapes by biquadratic transformation. Then, musical rules, template matching, run length coding and projection methods are employed to extract the musical note information without the application of staff removal.

This paper describes one such technique for improved staff line processing-the detection and subsequent correction of bowing in the staff lines, which is an important category given the significant source of music in book form. Two versions of the algorithm are tested: the first, based on mathematical morphology, has the added benefit of automatically fusing small breaks in staff lines, common for example in older works; the second, based on a flood-fill algorithm, requires a minor modification if fragmented staff lines are to be repaired. The correct detection and processing of staff lines is fundamental to OMR. Without adequate knowledge of staff line location, notation superimposed on the staves cannot be correctly separated, classified and processed.},

	challenges of numbered music notation, which is popular in Asia and
	used in daily life for sight reading. The authors use different way
	to improve recognition accuracy by applying elementary image processing
	with rough tuning and supplementing with methods of machine learning.
	The major contributions of this work are the architecture of machine
	learning specified for this task, the dataset, and the evaluation
	metrics, which indicate the performance of OMR system, provide objective
	function for machine learning and highlight the challenges of the
	scores of music with the specified notation.},

  abstract = {A neural network for recognition of handwritten musical notes, based on the well-known Neocognitron model, is described. The Neocognitron has been used for the ``what'' pathway (symbol recognition), while contextual knowledge has been applied for the ``where'' (symbol placement). This way, we benefit from dividing the process for dealing with this complicated recognition task. Also, different degrees of intrusiveness in ``learning'' have been incorporated in the same network: More intrusive supervised learning has been implemented in the lower neuron layers and less intrusive in the upper one. This way, the network adapts itself to the handwriting of the user. The network consists of a 13x49 input layer and three pairs of ``simple'' and ``complex'' neuron layers. It has been trained to recognize 20 symbols of unconnected notes on a musical staff and was tested with a set of unlearned input notes. Its recognition rate for the individual unseen notes was up to 93{\%}, averaging 80{\%} for all categories. These preliminary results indicate that a modified Neocognitron could be a good candidate for identification of handwritten musical notes.},

  abstract  = {String alignment and comparison in Computer Science is a well-explored space with
classic problems such as Longest Common Subsequence that have practical application
in bioinformatic genomic sequencing and data comparison in revision control systems.
In the field of musicology, score alignment and comparison is a problem with many
similarities to string comparison and alignment but also vast differences. In particular
we can use ideas in string alignment and comparison to compare a music score in the
MIDI format with a music score generated from Optical Musical Recognition (OMR),
both of which have incomplete or wrong information, and correct errors that were
introduced in the OMR process to create an improved third score. This thesis creates
a set of algorithms that align and compare MIDI and OMR music scores to produce a
corrected version of the OMR score that borrows ideas from classic computer science
string comparison and alignment algorithm but also incorporates optimizations and
heuristics from music theory.},
