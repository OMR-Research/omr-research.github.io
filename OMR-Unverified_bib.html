  abstract = {Optical music recognition is a complex problem because of the stave lines which link up the musical symbols. Thus, the standard approach of segmentation attempts to remove them, without cutting the symbols, by developing a complex algorithm or using them to operate on the zones they delimit. For the segmentation phase, some workers have tried considering a musical score as a set of line segments, but this approach is not appropriate to easy recognition. Our original approach to the segmentation problem is based on an exploitation of these lines and on the creation of virtual interlines according to the musical significance that they have. To limit the influence of the skew, line detection only appears at bar level. The same is true of the final recognition phase which can also deal with a local musical context local for each bar to render the identification. More accurate these lines and virtual interlines define the limits of 2*13 vertical projections (F and G clef) to detect the presence of musical information (patterns). These patterns are coded with 3 characters according to their forms and their relative height and width. A pattern position analysis combined with the score writing rules allow strings of chars matching 2 classes of musical symbols to be created (horizontal analysis to create slurs and vertical analysis for the others). These strings feed a syntactic analyzer for the final recognition according to their musical significance. The checking of the number of beats played in association with the tone of the bar and the identified alterations enables us to guarantee an optimal musical symbols recognition (5 Refs.) segmentation; pattern recognition},

Works on automatic recognition of printed music have been started in the late 1960s and early 1970s. And some recognition systems for music notation have been developed in Japan and Europe. This work presents an overview of works undertaken in the field of manipulating printed music by computer, and proposes a new method to recognize each music symbol using skeletal lines and run-length information. And the system for automatic recognition of printed piano music using the new method has been developed and tested. The result reveals 98.5\% accuracy for music symbols. The system shows size-independent, noise immune, and rotation-independent properties (28 Refs.) recognition},

  abstract = {This thesis deals with Optical Document Recognition. In this domain, reliability is an important point: the user should not have to proofread the whole document.
Reliability can be obtained by first improving the quality of the recognition - mostly by solving segmentation problems - and, second, by having the system itself
detect badly recognized zones. To fullfill these objectives, one must use a priori knowledge to solve segmentations problems and to represent redundancy, thus
allowing error detection. We chose in this thesis to work on Optical Music Recognition for its structured knowledge and because it has many unsolved segmentation
problems (mainly linked to information density). For this kind of document strongly syntaxed, we suggest a new method called DMOS (Description and
MOdification of Segmentation). It consists of a grammatical formalism of position (to define knowledge) and a parser allowing a dynamic modification of the parsed
structure. This modification allows us to introduce context (symbolic level) in segmentation (numeric level) in order to improve recognition. With knowledge
represented by a grammar, the DMOS method offers a separation between knowledge and program, and an automatic parser generation (through a compilation
phase). These two points greatly ease the management of complex knowledge. Using the formalism of position we have been able to define a grammar of the music
notation. The present system is already able to recognize some full scores with polyphonic staves by correcting some type of segmentation errors (like symbols
touching notes) and by pointing out badly recognized zones.},

Computers have been used in various fields of music, including applications for a music database, music CAI and visual input of musical information as well as music production tools. Music as the objective of cognitive science or artificial intelligence has been attracting great interest and international conferences have been held recently. The paper describes the technology and development trends in this field, referring to the basic technology of computer music, notation system, man-machine interaction system, music composition/arrangement systems and music recognition (16 Refs.) instruction; electronic music; music},

The system recognizes the pitch and the name of the instrument for each note in monaural music signals. The basic idea of the method is utilizing transition pattern of notes in music. Firstly, the results of statistical analyses of printed music are described. These have been conducted in order to obtain the note transition probabilities. Then the method for integrating such probabilistic information into recognition processes is introduced. The method has been implemented using the OPTIMA architecture and tested from several aspects. The results of the tests show that the proposed method improves the note recognition accuracy (6 Refs.)},

  abstract = {Formal models of music have been used as a design principle of automatic music recognition systems. These models range from statistical to generative/transformational models. However, the use of formal models in recognition problems implicitly impose data structures and algorithmic processes to the mechanism of perception and can result in inconsistent or extremely limited systems. By first modeling the perception mechanism as a statistical decision process merging sensory data and memory information, one can more readily identify the data elements and computational structures required for the recognition task and integrate formal representation(s) of music in a dynamically changing system (26 Refs.) music; statistics},

The authors demonstrated the performance of the completed system by experiments using real data (8 Refs.) transforms; optical character recognition},
