In the last two decades, our research mainly focused on the comprehensive description of music information, where multiple aspects are integrated to provide the user with an advanced multi-layer environment to experience music content. In recent times, the advancements in network technologies allowed a web implementation of this approach through W3C-compliant languages. The last obstacle to the use of personal devices is currently posed by the characteristics of mobile networks, concerning bandwidth, reliability, and the density of devices in an area. Designed to meet the requirements of future technological challenges, such as the Internet of Things and self-driving vehicles, the advent of 5G networks will solve these problems, thus paving the way also for new music-oriented applications. The possibilities described in this work range from bringing archive materials and music cultural heritage to a new life to the implementation of immersive environments for live-show remote experience.},

  abstract = {Automatic music transcription is considered by many to be a key enabling technology in music signal processing. However, the performance of transcription systems is still significantly below that of a human expert, and accuracies reported in recent years seem to have reached a limit, although the field is still very active. In this paper we analyse limitations of current methods and identify promising directions for future research. Current transcription methods use general purpose models which are unable to capture the rich diversity found in music signals. One way to overcome the limited performance of transcription systems is to tailor algorithms to specific use-cases. Semi-automatic approaches are another way of achieving a more reliable transcription. Also, the wealth of musical scores and corresponding audio data now available are a rich potential source of training data, via forced alignment of audio to scores, but large scale utilisation of such data has yet to be attempted. Other promising approaches include the integration of information from multiple algorithms and different musical aspects.},

	x-height normalization. A number of databases were used for training
	and testing, including the UW3 database, artificially generated and
	degraded Fraktur text and scanned pages from a book digitization
	project. The LSTM architecture achieved 0.6% character-level test-set
	error on English text. When the artificially degraded Fraktur data
	set is divided into training and test sets, the system achieves an
	error rate of 1.64%. On specific books printed in Fraktur (not part
	of the training set), the system achieves error rates of 0.15% (Fontane)

	without using any language modelling or any other post-processing

Among the different existing approaches, prototype selection ({PS}) and prototype generation ({PG}) are the most representative ones. These two families differ in the way the reduced set is obtained from the initial one: While the former aims at selecting the most representative elements from the set, the latter creates new data out of it. Although {PG} is considered to delimit more efficiently decision boundaries, the operations required are not so well defined in scenarios involving structural data such as strings, trees, or graphs. This work studies the possibility of using dissimilarity space ({DS}) methods as an intermediate process for mapping the initial structural representation to a statistical one, thereby allowing the use of {PG} methods. A comparative experiment over string data is carried out in which our proposal is faced to {PS} methods on the original space. Results show that the proposed strategy is able to achieve significantly similar results to {PS} in the initial space, thus standing as a clear alternative to the classic approach, with some additional advantages derived from the {DS} representation.},

  abstract  = {Abstract Interactive Pattern Recognition (IPR) is an emergent framework in which the user is involved actively in the recognition process by giving feedback to the system when an error is detected. Although this framework is expected to reduce the number of errors to correct, it may increase the time required to complete the task since the machine needs to recompute its proposal after each interaction. Therefore, a fast computation is required to make the interactive system profitable and user-friendly. This work presents an efficient approach to deal with {IPR} tasks when data has a sequential nature. Our approach includes some computation at the very beginning of the task but it then achieves a linear complexity after user corrections. We also show how these tasks can be effectively carried out if the solution space is defined with a Regular Language. This fact has indeed proven to be the most relevant factor to improve the efficiency of the approach. Several experiments are carried out in which our proposal is faced against a classical search. Results show a reduction in time in all experiments considered, solving efficiently some complex {IPR} tasks thanks to our proposals.},

  abstract = {Expressive performance is an indispensable part of music making.
When playing a piece, expert performers shape various parameters (tempo,
timing, dynamics, intonation, articulation, etc.) in ways that are not
prescribed by the notated score, in this way producing an expressive
rendition that brings out dramatic, affective, and emotional
qualities that may engage and affect the listeners.
Given the central importance of this skill for many kinds of music, expressive
performance has become an important research topic for disciplines like
musicology, music psychology, etc. 
This paper focuses on a specific thread of research: work on
computational music performance models. Computational models
are attempts at codifying hypotheses about expressive performance in terms of
mathematical formulas or computer programs, so that they can be evaluated in
systematic and quantitative ways. Such models can serve at least two main purposes:
they permit us to systematically study certain hypotheses regarding performance;
and they can be used as tools to generate automated or semi-automated performances,
in artistic or educational contexts.
The present article presents an up-to-date overview of the state of the art
in this domain. We explore recent trends in the field, such as a strong focus on
data-driven (machine learning); a growing interest in interactive expressive systems,
such as conductor simulators and automatic accompaniment systems; and an increased
interest in exploring cognitively plausible features and models.
We provide an in-depth discussion of several important design choices in
such computer models, and discuss a crucial (and still largely unsolved)
problem that is hindering systematic progress: the question of how to
evaluate such models in scientifically and musically meaningful ways.
From all this, we finally derive some research directions that should be pursued
with priority, in order to advance the field and our understanding
of expressive music performance.},

In previous work, we have shown that such architectures are comparable to state-of-the-art ASR systems on dictation tasks, but it was not clear if such architectures would be practical for more challenging tasks such as voice search. In this work, we explore a variety of structural and optimization improvements to our LAS model which significantly improve performance. On the structural side, we show that word piece models can be used instead of graphemes. We also introduce a multi-head attention architecture, which offers improvements over the commonly-used single-head attention. On the optimization side, we explore synchronous training, scheduled sampling, label smoothing, and minimum word error rate optimization, which are all shown to improve accuracy. We present results with a unidirectional LSTM encoder for streaming recognition. On a 12, 500 hour voice search task, we find that the proposed changes improve the WER from 9.2% to 5.6%, while the best conventional system achieves 6.7%; on a dictation task our model achieves a WER of 4.1% compared to 5% for the conventional system.},

	region. Text reading showed pure alexia in which both the phonological
	and global routes were damaged. His ability to read correctly via
	matching tests showed that the word-form system was preserved. The
	reading of musical scores was damaged too and showed a dissociation
	between the reading of ideograms and rhythms (preserved) and the
	reading of notes (impaired). The results of note reading were analogous
	to those of word reading. Furthermore, the patient could read notes
	correctly via matching tests. On the basis of these findings, we
	propose a model of music reading where the reading of notes is based
	on a representational system analogous to that of words (the so-called
	internal language) whereas reading of ideograms and rhythms occurs
	via an internal representation unrelated to linguistic functions.},

Berklee College of Music brings together teachers and students from all over the world, and we use notation in a great variety of ways. This book presents our perspectives on notation: what we have found to be the most commonly used practices in today's music industry, and what seems to be serving our community best. It includes a foreword by Matthew Nicholl, who was a long-time chair of Berklee's Contemporary Writing and Production Department. Whether you find yourself in a Nashville recording studio, Hollywood sound stage, grand concert hall, worship choir loft, or elementary school auditorium, this book will help you to create readable, professional, publication-quality notation. Beyond understanding the standard rules and definitions, you will learn to make appropriate choices for your own work, and generally how to achieve clarity and consistency in your notation so that it best serves your music.},

In this paper, we apply the feature extraction and modeling techniques commonly used in automatic speech recognition to solving the problem of segmentation and instrument identification of musical passages. The correlation among the different components in the feature space and the auto-correlation of each component are analyzed to demonstrate feasibility in musical signal analysis and instrument class modeling. Our experimental results are first evaluated on 3 instrument categories, i.e. vocal music, instrumental music, and their combinations. Furthermore each category is split into two individual cases to give a 6-class problem. Our results show that good performance could be obtained with simple features, such as mel-frequency cepstral coefficients and cepstral coefficients derived from linear prediction signal analysis. Even with a limited amount of training data, we could give an accuracy of 90.60% in the case of three categories. A slightly worse accuracy of 90.38% is obtained when we double the number of categories to six classes.},

This paper proposes a novel digital image binarization scheme for low quality historical documents allowing further content exploitation in an efficient way. The proposed scheme consists of five distinct steps: a pre-processing procedure using a low-pass Wiener filter, a rough estimation of foreground regions using Niblack's approach, a background surface calculation by interpolating neighboring background intensities, a thresholding by combining the calculated background surface with the original image and finally a post-processing step in order to improve the quality of text regions and preserve stroke connectivity. The proposed methodology works with great success even in cases of historical manuscripts with poor quality, shadows, nonuniform illumination, low contrast, large signal- dependent noise, smear and strain. After testing the proposed method on numerous low quality historical manuscripts, it has turned out that our methodology performs better compared to current state-of-the-art adaptive thresholding techniques.},

  abstract = {Vast collections of documents available in image format need to be indexed for information retrieval purposes. In this framework, word spotting is an alternative solution to optical character recognition (OCR), which is rather inefficient for recognizing text of degraded quality and unknown fonts usually appearing in printed text, or writing style variations in handwritten documents. Over the past decade there has been a growing interest in addressing document indexing using word spotting which is reflected by the continuously increasing number of approaches. However, there exist very few comprehensive studies which analyze the various aspects of a word spotting system. This work aims to review the recent approaches as well as fill the gaps in several topics with respect to the related works. The nature of texts and inherent challenges addressed by word spotting methods are thoroughly examined. After presenting the core steps which compose a word spotting system, we investigate the use of retrieval enhancement techniques based on relevance feedback which improve the retrieved results. Finally, we present the datasets which are widely used for word spotting, we describe the evaluation standards and measures applied for performance assessment and discuss the results achieved by the state of the art.},

  abstract      = {Recognizing arbitrary multi-character text in unconstrained natural photographs is a hard problem. In this paper, we address an equally hard sub-problem in this domain viz. recognizing arbitrary multi-digit numbers from Street View imagery. Traditional approaches to solve this problem typically separate out the localization, segmentation, and recognition steps. In this paper we propose a unified approach that integrates these three steps via the use of a deep convolutional neural network that operates directly on the image pixels. We employ the DistBelief implementation of deep neural networks in order to train large, distributed neural networks on high quality images. We find that the performance of this approach increases with the depth of the convolutional network, with the best performance occurring in the deepest architecture we trained, with eleven hidden layers. We evaluate this approach on the publicly available {SVHN} dataset and achieve over 96% accuracy in recognizing complete street numbers. We show that on a per-digit recognition task, we improve upon the state-of-the-art, achieving 97.84% accuracy. We also evaluate this approach on an even more challenging dataset generated from Street View imagery containing several tens of millions of street number annotations and achieve over 90% accuracy. To further explore the applicability of the proposed system to broader text recognition tasks, we apply it to synthetic distorted text from re{CAPTCHA}. re{CAPTCHA} is one of the most secure reverse turing tests that uses distorted text to distinguish humans from bots. We report a 99.8% accuracy on the hardest category of re{CAPTCHA}. Our evaluations on both tasks indicate that at specific operating thresholds, the performance of the proposed system is comparable to, and in some cases exceeds, that of human operators.},

Twenty-four graduate music students were selected as skilled and less- skilled music readers. Eye position was measured every millisecond with a high degree of accuracy. The factorial design was 2 Groups x 4 Melodies x 3 Encounters (including a practice period). Results indicated that patterns of eye movement in the two groups were similar across melodies and encounters, but differed with notational complexity. Eye movement was reduced when performing melodies with more-concentrated visual information than when performing melodies with less- concentrated visual information. The main effect of encounters indicated that music readers used fewer but longer fixations after practicing the melodies. Results suggest that skilled music readers look farther ahead in the notation, and then back to the point of performance, when sightreading.},

Each subject read three melodies of varying levels of concentration of visual detail. The profiles indicates the order, duration, and location of each fixation while the subjects sightread the melodies. Results indicate that music readers do not fixate on note stems or the bar lines that connect eighth notes when sightreading. The less-skilled music reader progressed through the melody virtually note-by-note using long fixations, whereas the skilled sightreader directed fixations to all areas of the notation (using more regressions than the less-skilled reader) to perform the music accurately. Results support earlier findings that skilled sightreaders look farther ahead in the notation, then back to the point of performance (Goolsby, 1994), and have a larger perceptual span than less-skilled sightreaders. Findings support Slobodans (1984) contention that music reading (i. e., sightreading) is indeed music perception, because music notation is processed before performance. Support was found for Sloboda's (1977, 1984, 1985, 1988) hypotheses on the effects of physical and structural boundaries on visual musical perception. The profiles indicate a number of differences between music perception from processing visual notation and perception resulting from language reading. These differences include: (1) opposite trends in the control of eye movement (i. e., the better music reader fixates in blank areas of the visual stimuli and not directly on each item of the information that was performed), (2) a perceptual span that is vertical as well as horizontal, (3) more eye movement associated with the better reader, and (4) greater attention used for processing language than for music, although the latter task requires an "exact realization."},

End-to-end training methods such as Connectionist Temporal Classification make it possible to train RNNs for sequence labelling problems where the input-output alignment is unknown. The combination of these methods with the Long Short-term Memory RNN architecture has proved particularly fruitful, delivering state-of-the-art results in cursive handwriting recognition. However RNN performance in speech recognition has so far been disappointing, with better results returned by deep feedforward networks. This paper investigates deep recurrent neural networks, which combine the multiple levels of representation that have proved so effective in deep networks with the flexible use of long range context that empowers RNNs. When trained end-to-end with suitable regularisation, we find that deep Long Short-term Memory RNNs achieve a test set error of 17.7% on the TIMIT phoneme recognition benchmark, which to our knowledge is the best recorded score.},

  abstract = {Information about manuscripts and printed music indexed in RISM (R{\'e}pertoire International des Sources Musicales), a large, international project that records and describes musical sources, was for decades available solely through book publications, CD-ROMs, or subscription services. Recent initiatives to make the data available on a wider scale have resulted in, most significantly, a freely accessible online database and the availability of its data as open data and linked open data. Previously, the task of increasing the amount of data was primarily carried out by RISM national groups and the Zentralredaktion (Central Office). The current opportunities available by linking to other freely accessible databases and importing data from other resources open new perspectives and prospects. This paper describes the RISM data and their applications for digital libraries and digital musicological projects. We discuss the possibilities and challenges in making available a large and growing quantity of data and how the data have been utilized in external library and musicological projects. Interactive functions in the RISM OPAC are planned for the future, as is closer collaboration with the projects that use RISM data. Ultimately, RISM would like to arrange a ``take and give'' system in which the RISM data are used in external projects, enhanced by the project participants, and then delivered back to the RISM Zentralredaktion.},

  abstract = {Multilayer neural networks trained with the back-propagation algorithm constitute the best example of a successful gradient based learning technique. Given an appropriate network architecture, gradient-based learning algorithms can be used to synthesize a complex decision surface that can classify high-dimensional patterns, such as handwritten characters, with minimal preprocessing. This paper reviews various methods applied to handwritten character recognition and compares them on a standard handwritten digit recognition task. Convolutional neural networks, which are specifically designed to deal with the variability of 2D shapes, are shown to outperform all other techniques. Real-life document recognition systems are composed of multiple modules including field extraction, segmentation recognition, and language modeling. A new learning paradigm, called graph transformer networks (GTN), allows such multimodule systems to be trained globally using gradient-based methods so as to minimize an overall performance measure. Two systems for online handwriting recognition are described. Experiments demonstrate the advantage of global training, and the flexibility of graph transformer networks. A graph transformer network for reading a bank cheque is also described. It uses convolutional neural network character recognizers combined with global training techniques to provide record accuracy on business and personal cheques. It is deployed commercially and reads several million cheques per day.},

	Faster R-CNN, one of the state-of-the-art object detection methods,

	lies borderline of real time application, i.e. 5fps with VGG16 model
	in K40 GPU system in [1]. Moreover, computation time depends on model
	and image crop size, but precision is also affected; usually, time
	and precision have trade-off relation. By adjusting input image size
	in spite of downgrading performance, computation time meets criteria
	for one model. Therefore, selection of a model is one of the important
	problems when faster R-CNN based object detection system for an autonomous
	robot is constructed. In this paper, we convert several state-of-the-art
	models from convolution neural network (CNN) for image classification.
	Then, we compare converted models with several image crop size in
	terms of computation time and detection precision. We will utilize
	those comparison data for selecting a proper detection model in case
	a robot needs to perform an object detection task.},

With a total of 2.5 million labeled instances in 328k images, the creation of our dataset drew upon extensive crowd worker involvement via novel user interfaces for category detection, instance spotting and instance segmentation. We present a detailed statistical analysis of the dataset in comparison to PASCAL, ImageNet, and SUN. Finally, we provide baseline performance analysis for bounding box and segmentation detection results using a Deformable Parts Model.},

  abstract  = {We present a method for detecting objects in images using a single deep neural network. Our approach, named SSD, discretizes the output space of bounding boxes into a set of default boxes over different aspect ratios and scales per feature map location. At prediction time, the network generates scores for the presence of each object category in each default box and produces adjustments to the box to better match the object shape. Additionally, the network combines predictions from multiple feature maps with different resolutions to naturally handle objects of various sizes. SSD is simple relative to methods that require object proposals because it completely eliminates proposal generation and subsequent pixel or feature resampling stages and encapsulates all computation in a single network. This makes SSD easy to train and straightforward to integrate into systems that require a detection component. Experimental results on the PASCAL VOC, COCO, and ILSVRC datasets confirm that SSD has competitive accuracy to methods that utilize an additional object proposal step and is much faster, while providing a unified framework for both training and inference. For 300x300 input, SSD achieves 74.3% mAP on VOC2007 test at 59Â FPS on a Nvidia Titan X and for 512x512 input, SSD achieves 76.9% mAP, outperforming a comparable state of the art Faster R-CNN model. Compared to other single stage methods, SSD has much better accuracy even with a smaller input image size. Code is available at https://github.com/weiliu89/caffe/tree/ssd.},

With novel digitising techniques is now possible to have these books stored in digital format and accessible to a wider public. However it remains the problem of how to use them. DEBORA (Digital accEss to BOoks of the RenAissance) is a European project that aims to develop a system to interact with these books through world-wide networks. The main issue is to build a database accessible through client computers. That will require to built accompanying metadata that should characterise different components of the books as illuminated letters, banners, figures and key words in order to simplify and speed up the remote access. To solve these problems, digital image analysis algorithms regarding filtering, segmentation, separation of text from non-text, lines and word segmentation and word recognition were developed. Some novel ideas are presented and illustrated through examples.},

The evaluation of a binarization method aids in studying its algorithmic behavior, as well as verifying its effectiveness, by providing qualitative and quantitative indication of its performance. This paper addresses a pixel-based binarization evaluation methodology for historical handwritten/machine-printed document images. In the proposed evaluation scheme, the recall and precision evaluation measures are properly modified using a weighting scheme that diminishes any potential evaluation bias. Additional performance metrics of the proposed evaluation scheme consist of the percentage rates of broken and missed text, false alarms, background noise, character enlargement, and merging. Several experiments conducted in comparison with other pixel-based evaluation measures demonstrate the validity of the proposed evaluation scheme.},

However, it is well known that the Baum-Welch algorithm tends to arrive at local optimal points. In this report, we investigate the potential of the Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO) as an alternative method for HMM parameters estimation. The domain in this study is the recognition of handwritten music notations. Three observables: (i) sequence of ink patterns, (ii) stroke information and (iii) spatial information associated with eight musical symbols were recorded. Sixteen HMM models were built from the data. Eight HMM models for eight musical symbols were built from the parameters estimated using the Baum-Welch algorithm and the other eight models were built from the parameters estimated using PSO. The experiment shows that the performances of HMM models, using parameters estimated from PSO and Baum-Welch approach, are comparable. We suggest that PSO or a combination of PSO and Baum-Welch algorithm could be alternative approaches for the HMM parameters estimation.},

  abstract  = {Tables are an easy way to represent information in a structural form. Table recognition is important for the extraction of such information from document images. Usually, modern OCR systems provide textual information coming from tables without recognizing actual table structure. However, recognition of table structure is important to get the contextual meaning of the contents. Table structure recognition in heterogeneous documents is challenging due to a variety of table layouts. It becomes harder where no physical rulings are present in a table. This work proposes a novel learning based methodology for the recognition of table contents in heterogeneous document images. Textual contents of documents are classified as table or non-table elements using a pre-trained neural network model. The output of the neural network is further enhanced by applying a contextual post processing on each element to correct the classifications errors if any. The system is trained using a subset of UNLV and UW3 document images and depicted more than 97% accuracy on a test set in detection of table and non-table elements.},

  abstract  = {We introduce YOLO9000, a state-of-the-art, real-time object detection system that can detect over 9000 object categories. First we propose various improvements to the YOLO detection method, both novel and drawn from prior work. The improved model, YOLOv2, is state-of-the-art on standard detection tasks like PASCAL VOC and COCO. Using a novel, multi-scale training method the same YOLOv2 model can run at varying sizes, offering an easy tradeoff between speed and accuracy. At 67 FPS, YOLOv2 gets 76.8 mAP on VOC 2007. At 40 FPS, YOLOv2 gets 78.6 mAP, outperforming state-of-the-art methods like Faster RCNN with ResNet and SSD while still running significantly faster. Finally we propose a method to jointly train on object detection and classification. Using this method we train YOLO9000 simultaneously on the COCO detection dataset and the ImageNet classification dataset. Our joint training allows YOLO9000 to predict detections for object classes that dont have labelled detection data. We validate our approach on the ImageNet detection task. YOLO9000 gets 19.7 mAP on the ImageNet detection validation set despite only having detection data for 44 of the 200 classes. On the 156 classes not in COCO, YOLO9000 gets 16.0 mAP. YOLO9000 predicts detections for more than 9000 different object categories, all in real-time.},

In this paper, we present a network and training strategy that relies on the strong use of data augmentation to use the available annotated samples more efficiently. The architecture consists of a contracting path to capture context and a symmetric expanding path that enables precise localization. We show that such a network can be trained end-to-end from very few images and outperforms the prior best method (a sliding-window convolutional network) on the {ISBI} challenge for segmentation of neuronal structures in electron microscopic stacks. Using the same network trained on transmitted light microscopy images (phase contrast and {DIC}) we won the {ISBI} cell tracking challenge 2015 in these categories by a large margin. Moreover, the network is fast. Segmentation of a 512x512 image takes less than a second on a recent {GPU}.

Yet, the accessibility to these documents with respect to browsing and searching remained limited as full automatic transcription is often not possible or not sufficiently accurate. This paper proposes a novel reliable approach for template-based keyword spotting in historical handwritten documents. In particular, our framework makes use of different graph representations for segmented word images and a sophisticated matching procedure. Moreover, we extend our method to a spotting ensemble. In an exhaustive experimental evaluation on four widely used benchmark datasets we show that the proposed approach is able to keep up or even outperform several state-of-the-art methods for template- and learning-based keyword spotting.},

In this paper, we propose a novel document image binarization technique that addresses these issues by using adaptive image contrast. The adaptive image contrast is a combination of the local image contrast and the local image gradient that is tolerant to text and background variation caused by different types of document degradations. In the proposed technique, an adaptive contrast map is first constructed for an input degraded document image. The contrast map is then binarized and combined with Canny's edge map to identify the text stroke edge pixels. The document text is further segmented by a local threshold that is estimated based on the intensities of detected text stroke edge pixels within a local window. The proposed method is simple, robust, and involves minimum parameter tuning. It has been tested on three public datasets that are used in the recent document image binarization contest ({DIBCO}) 2009 {\&} 2011 and handwritten-{DIBCO} 2010 and achieves accuracies of 93.5{\%}, 87.8{\%}, and 92.03{\%}, respectively, that are significantly higher than or close to that of the best-performing methods reported in the three contests. Experiments on the Bickley diary dataset that consists of several challenging bad quality document images also show the superior performance of our proposed method, compared with other techniques.},

Binarization of scanned gray scale images is the first step in most document image analysis systems. Selection of an appropriate binarization method for an input image domain is a difficult problem. Typically, a human expert evaluates the binarized images according to his/her visual criteria. However, to conduct an objective evaluation, one needs to investigate how well the subsequent image analysis steps will perform on the binarized image. We call this approach goal-directed evaluation, and it can be used to evaluate other low-level image processing methods as well. Our evaluation of binarization methods is in the context of digit recognition, so we define the performance of the character recognition module as the objective measure. Eleven different locally adaptive binarization methods were evaluated, and Niblack's method gave the best performance.},

Eight locally adaptive binarization methods were tested on five different images.

  abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of generating possible object locations for use in object recognition. We introduce selective search which combines the strength of both an exhaustive search and segmentation. Like segmentation, we use the image structure to guide our sampling process. Like exhaustive search, we aim to capture all possible object locations. Instead of a single technique to generate possible object locations, we diversify our search and use a variety of complementary image partitionings to deal with as many image conditions as possible. Our selective search results in a small set of data-driven, class-independent, high quality locations, yielding 99Â {\%} recall and a Mean Average Best Overlap of 0.879 at 10,097 locations. The reduced number of locations compared to an exhaustive search enables the use of stronger machine learning techniques and stronger appearance models for object recognition. In this paper we show that our selective search enables the use of the powerful Bag-of-Words model for recognition. The selective search software is made publicly available (Software:  http://disi.unitn.it/~uijlings/SelectiveSearch.html ).},

The proposed algorithm combines the characteristics of the {OFF} center-surround cells of the {HVS} with the classic Otsu binarization technique. Cells of two different scales are combined, increasing the efficiency of the algorithm and reducing the extracted noise in the final output. A new response function, which regulates the output of the cell according to the local contrast and the local lighting conditions is also introduced. The Otsu technique is used to binarize the outputs of the {OFF} center-surround cells. Quantitative experiments performed on a set of various computer-generated degradations, such as noise, shadow, and low contrast demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method against six other well-established techniques. Qualitative and {OCR} comparisons also confirm these results.},

	on-line trainingâ€”often orders of magnitude slowerâ€”especially on large
	training sets. The main reason is due to the ability of on-line training
	to follow curves in the error surface throughout each epoch, which
	allows it to safely use a larger learning rate and thus converge
	with less iterations through the training data. Empirical results
	on a large (20,000-instance) speech recognition task and on 26 other
	learning tasks demonstrate that convergence can be reached significantly
	faster using on-line training than batch training, with no apparent
	difference in accuracy.},

  abstract = {Abstract Machine recognition of a handwritten mathematical expression ({HME}) is challenging due to the ambiguities of handwritten symbols and the two-dimensional structure of mathematical expressions. Inspired by recent work in deep learning, we present Watch, Attend and Parse ({WAP}), a novel end-to-end approach based on neural network that learns to recognize \{HMEs\} in a two-dimensional layout and outputs them as one-dimensional character sequences in LaTeX format. Inherently unlike traditional methods, our proposed model avoids problems that stem from symbol segmentation, and it does not require a predefined expression grammar. Meanwhile, the problems of symbol recognition and structural analysis are handled, respectively, using a watcher and a parser. We employ a convolutional neural network encoder that takes \{HME\} images as input as the watcher and employ a recurrent neural network decoder equipped with an attention mechanism as the parser to generate LaTeX sequences. Moreover, the correspondence between the input expressions and the output LaTeX sequences is learned automatically by the attention mechanism. We validate the proposed approach on a benchmark published by the \{CROHME\} international competition. Using the official training dataset, \{WAP\} significantly outperformed the state-of-the-art method with an expression recognition accuracy of 46.55% on \{CROHME\} 2014 and 44.55% on \{CROHME\} 2016. },

  abstract  = {The use of object proposals is an effective recent approach for increasing
	the computational efficiency of object detection. We propose a novel
	method for generating object bounding box proposals using edges.
	Edges provide a sparse yet informative representation of an image.
	Our main observation is that the number of contours that are wholly
	contained in a bounding box is indicative of the likelihood of the
	box containing an object. We propose a simple box objectness score
	that measures the number of edges that exist in the box minus those
	that are members of contours that overlap the box's boundary. Using
	efficient data structures, millions of candidate boxes can be evaluated
	in a fraction of a second, returning a ranked set of a few thousand
	top-scoring proposals. Using standard metrics, we show results that
	are significantly more accurate than the current state-of-the-art
	while being faster to compute. In particular, given just 1000 proposals
	we achieve over 96% object recall at overlap threshold of 0.5 and
	over 75% recall at the more challenging overlap of 0.7. Our approach
	runs in 0.25 seconds and we additionally demonstrate a near real-time
	variant with only minor loss in accuracy.},
