First, document image segmentation and character segmentation are carried out using three basic features and the knowledge of document layout rules. Next, multi-font character recognition is performed based on feature vector matching. Recognition experiments with a prototype system for a variety of complex printed documents shows that the proposed system is capable of reading different types of printed documents at an accuracy rate of 94.8–97.2%.},

  abstract = {This paper focuses on new models to enjoy music that will be implementable in a near future thanks to 5G technology. In the last two decades, our research mainly focused on the comprehensive description of music information, where multiple aspects are integrated to provide the user with an advanced multi-layer environment to experience music content. In recent times, the advancements in network technologies allowed a web implementation of this approach through W3C-compliant languages. The last obstacle to the use of personal devices is currently posed by the characteristics of mobile networks, concerning bandwidth, reliability, and the density of devices in an area. Designed to meet the requirements of future technological challenges, such as the Internet of Things and self-driving vehicles, the advent of 5G networks will solve these problems, thus paving the way also for new music-oriented applications. The possibilities described in this work range from bringing archive materials and music cultural heritage to a new life to the implementation of immersive environments for live-show remote experience.},

The use of template matching gives the user the unusual ability to modify the set of templates used for analysis. This modification effects a tradeoff between the temporal accuracy required of the input and the complexity of the recognizable rhythm patterns that happen to be common in a particular piece of music. The evolving implementation of this algorithm has received heavy use over a six-year period and has proven itself as a practical and reliable input method for fast music transcription. It is concluded that templates demonstrably provide the necessary temporal context for accurate rhythm recognition.<<ETX>>},

	bidirectional LSTM networks to the problem of machine-printed Latin
	and Fraktur recognition. Latin and Fraktur recognition differs significantly
	from handwriting recognition in both the statistical properties of
	the data, as well as in the required, much higher levels of accuracy.
	Applications of LSTM networks to handwriting recognition use two-dimensional
	recurrent networks, since the exact position and baseline of handwritten
	characters is variable. In contrast, for printed OCR, we used a one-dimensional
	recurrent network combined with a novel algorithm for baseline and
	x-height normalization. A number of databases were used for training
	and testing, including the UW3 database, artificially generated and
	degraded Fraktur text and scanned pages from a book digitization
	project. The LSTM architecture achieved 0.6% character-level test-set
	error on English text. When the artificially degraded Fraktur data
	set is divided into training and test sets, the system achieves an
	error rate of 1.64%. On specific books printed in Fraktur (not part
	of the training set), the system achieves error rates of 0.15% (Fontane)
	and 1.47% (Ersch-Gruber). These recognition accuracies were found
	without using any language modelling or any other post-processing
	techniques.},

  abstract = {Abstract Interactive Pattern Recognition (IPR) is an emergent framework in which the user is involved actively in the recognition process by giving feedback to the system when an error is detected. Although this framework is expected to reduce the number of errors to correct, it may increase the time required to complete the task since the machine needs to recompute its proposal after each interaction. Therefore, a fast computation is required to make the interactive system profitable and user-friendly. This work presents an efficient approach to deal with {IPR} tasks when data has a sequential nature. Our approach includes some computation at the very beginning of the task but it then achieves a linear complexity after user corrections. We also show how these tasks can be effectively carried out if the solution space is defined with a Regular Language. This fact has indeed proven to be the most relevant factor to improve the efficiency of the approach. Several experiments are carried out in which our proposal is faced against a classical search. Results show a reduction in time in all experiments considered, solving efficiently some complex {IPR} tasks thanks to our proposals.},

Since it started in 2005, MIREX has fostered great advancements not only in many specific areas of MIR, but also in our general understanding of how MIR systems and algorithms are to be evaluated. This chapter outlines some of the major highlights of the past four years of MIREX evaluations, including its organizing principles, the selection of evaluation metrics, and the evolution of evaluation tasks. The chapter concludes with a brief introduction of how MIREX plans to expand into the future using a suite of Web 2.0 technologies to automated MIREX evaluations.},

	region. Text reading showed pure alexia in which both the phonological
	and global routes were damaged. His ability to read correctly via
	matching tests showed that the word-form system was preserved. The
	reading of musical scores was damaged too and showed a dissociation
	between the reading of ideograms and rhythms (preserved) and the
	reading of notes (impaired). The results of note reading were analogous
	to those of word reading. Furthermore, the patient could read notes
	correctly via matching tests. On the basis of these findings, we
	propose a model of music reading where the reading of notes is based
	on a representational system analogous to that of words (the so-called
	internal language) whereas reading of ideograms and rhythms occurs
	via an internal representation unrelated to linguistic functions.},

You will learn the meaning and stylistic practices for many types of notation that are currently in common use, from traditional staffs to lead sheets to guitar tablature. It discusses hundreds of notation symbols, as well as general guidelines for writing music. Berklee College of Music brings together teachers and students from all over the world, and we use notation in a great variety of ways. This book presents our perspectives on notation: what we have found to be the most commonly used practices in today's music industry, and what seems to be serving our community best. It includes a foreword by Matthew Nicholl, who was a long-time chair of Berklee's Contemporary Writing and Production Department. Whether you find yourself in a Nashville recording studio, Hollywood sound stage, grand concert hall, worship choir loft, or elementary school auditorium, this book will help you to create readable, professional, publication-quality notation. Beyond understanding the standard rules and definitions, you will learn to make appropriate choices for your own work, and generally how to achieve clarity and consistency in your notation so that it best serves your music.}

In this paper, we apply the feature extraction and modeling techniques commonly used in automatic speech recognition to solving the problem of segmentation and instrument identification of musical passages. The correlation among the different components in the feature space and the auto-correlation of each component are analyzed to demonstrate feasibility in musical signal analysis and instrument class modeling. Our experimental results are first evaluated on 3 instrument categories, i.e. vocal music, instrumental music, and their combinations. Furthermore each category is split into two individual cases to give a 6-class problem. Our results show that good performance could be obtained with simple features, such as mel-frequency cepstral coefficients and cepstral coefficients derived from linear prediction signal analysis. Even with a limited amount of training data, we could give an accuracy of 90.60% in the case of three categories. A slightly worse accuracy of 90.38% is obtained when we double the number of categories to six classes.},

This paper proposes a novel digital image binarization scheme for low quality historical documents allowing further content exploitation in an efficient way. The proposed scheme consists of five distinct steps: a pre-processing procedure using a low-pass Wiener filter, a rough estimation of foreground regions using Niblack's approach, a background surface calculation by interpolating neighboring background intensities, a thresholding by combining the calculated background surface with the original image and finally a post-processing step in order to improve the quality of text regions and preserve stroke connectivity. The proposed methodology works with great success even in cases of historical manuscripts with poor quality, shadows, nonuniform illumination, low contrast, large signal- dependent noise, smear and strain. After testing the proposed method on numerous low quality historical manuscripts, it has turned out that our methodology performs better compared to current state-of-the-art adaptive thresholding techniques.},

  abstract = {Vast collections of documents available in image format need to be indexed for information retrieval purposes. In this framework, word spotting is an alternative solution to optical character recognition (OCR), which is rather inefficient for recognizing text of degraded quality and unknown fonts usually appearing in printed text, or writing style variations in handwritten documents. Over the past decade there has been a growing interest in addressing document indexing using word spotting which is reflected by the continuously increasing number of approaches. However, there exist very few comprehensive studies which analyze the various aspects of a word spotting system. This work aims to review the recent approaches as well as fill the gaps in several topics with respect to the related works. The nature of texts and inherent challenges addressed by word spotting methods are thoroughly examined. After presenting the core steps which compose a word spotting system, we investigate the use of retrieval enhancement techniques based on relevance feedback which improve the retrieved results. Finally, we present the datasets which are widely used for word spotting, we describe the evaluation standards and measures applied for performance assessment and discuss the results achieved by the state of the art.},

Twenty-four graduate music students were selected as skilled and less- skilled music readers. Eye position was measured every millisecond with a high degree of accuracy. The factorial design was 2 Groups x 4 Melodies x 3 Encounters (including a practice period). Results indicated that patterns of eye movement in the two groups were similar across melodies and encounters, but differed with notational complexity. Eye movement was reduced when performing melodies with more-concentrated visual information than when performing melodies with less- concentrated visual information. The main effect of encounters indicated that music readers used fewer but longer fixations after practicing the melodies. Results suggest that skilled music readers look farther ahead in the notation, and then back to the point of performance, when sightreading.},

  abstract = {Temporal and sequential components of the eye movement used by a skilled and a less-skilled sightreader were used to construct six profiles of processing. Each subject read three melodies of varying levels of concentration of visual detail. The profiles indicates the order, duration, and location of each fixation while the subjects sightread the melodies. Results indicate that music readers do not fixate on note stems or the bar lines that connect eighth notes when sightreading. The less-skilled music reader progressed through the melody virtually note-by-note using long fixations, whereas the skilled sightreader directed fixations to all areas of the notation (using more regressions than the less-skilled reader) to perform the music accurately. Results support earlier findings that skilled sightreaders look farther ahead in the notation, then back to the point of performance (Goolsby, 1994), and have a larger perceptual span than less-skilled sightreaders. Findings support Slobodans (1984) contention that music reading (i. e., sightreading) is indeed music perception, because music notation is processed before performance. Support was found for Sloboda's (1977, 1984, 1985, 1988) hypotheses on the effects of physical and structural boundaries on visual musical perception. The profiles indicate a number of differences between music perception from processing visual notation and perception resulting from language reading. These differences include: (1) opposite trends in the control of eye movement (i. e., the better music reader fixates in blank areas of the visual stimuli and not directly on each item of the information that was performed), (2) a perceptual span that is vertical as well as horizontal, (3) more eye movement associated with the better reader, and (4) greater attention used for processing language than for music, although the latter task requires an "exact realization."},

  abstract = {Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are a powerful model for sequential data. End-to-end training methods such as Connectionist Temporal Classification make it possible to train RNNs for sequence labelling problems where the input-output alignment is unknown. The combination of these methods with the Long Short-term Memory RNN architecture has proved particularly fruitful, delivering state-of-the-art results in cursive handwriting recognition. However RNN performance in speech recognition has so far been disappointing, with better results returned by deep feedforward networks. This paper investigates deep recurrent neural networks, which combine the multiple levels of representation that have proved so effective in deep networks with the flexible use of long range context that empowers RNNs. When trained end-to-end with suitable regularisation, we find that deep Long Short-term Memory RNNs achieve a test set error of 17.7% on the TIMIT phoneme recognition benchmark, which to our knowledge is the best recorded score.},

  abstract = {Information about manuscripts and printed music indexed in RISM (R{\'e}pertoire International des Sources Musicales), a large, international project that records and describes musical sources, was for decades available solely through book publications, CD-ROMs, or subscription services. Recent initiatives to make the data available on a wider scale have resulted in, most significantly, a freely accessible online database and the availability of its data as open data and linked open data. Previously, the task of increasing the amount of data was primarily carried out by RISM national groups and the Zentralredaktion (Central Office). The current opportunities available by linking to other freely accessible databases and importing data from other resources open new perspectives and prospects. This paper describes the RISM data and their applications for digital libraries and digital musicological projects. We discuss the possibilities and challenges in making available a large and growing quantity of data and how the data have been utilized in external library and musicological projects. Interactive functions in the RISM OPAC are planned for the future, as is closer collaboration with the projects that use RISM data. Ultimately, RISM would like to arrange a ``take and give'' system in which the RISM data are used in external projects, enhanced by the project participants, and then delivered back to the RISM Zentralredaktion.},

Given an appropriate network architecture, gradient-based learning algorithms can be used to synthesize a complex decision surface that can classify high-dimensional patterns, such as handwritten characters, with minimal preprocessing. This paper reviews various methods applied to handwritten character recognition and compares them on a standard handwritten digit recognition task. Convolutional neural networks, which are specifically designed to deal with the variability of 2D shapes, are shown to outperform all other techniques. Real-life document recognition systems are composed of multiple modules including field extraction, segmentation recognition, and language modeling. A new learning paradigm, called graph transformer networks (GTN), allows such multimodule systems to be trained globally using gradient-based methods so as to minimize an overall performance measure. Two systems for online handwriting recognition are described. Experiments demonstrate the advantage of global training, and the flexibility of graph transformer networks. A graph transformer network for reading a bank cheque is also described. It uses convolutional neural network character recognizers combined with global training techniques to provide record accuracy on business and personal cheques. It is deployed commercially and reads several million cheques per day.},

	Faster R-CNN, one of the state-of-the-art object detection methods,
	approaches real time application; nevertheless, computational time
	lies borderline of real time application, i.e. 5fps with VGG16 model
	in K40 GPU system in [1]. Moreover, computation time depends on model
	and image crop size, but precision is also affected; usually, time
	and precision have trade-off relation. By adjusting input image size
	in spite of downgrading performance, computation time meets criteria
	for one model. Therefore, selection of a model is one of the important
	problems when faster R-CNN based object detection system for an autonomous
	robot is constructed. In this paper, we convert several state-of-the-art
	models from convolution neural network (CNN) for image classification.
	Then, we compare converted models with several image crop size in
	terms of computation time and detection precision. We will utilize
	those comparison data for selecting a proper detection model in case
	a robot needs to perform an object detection task.},

Objects are labeled using per-instance segmentations to aid in precise object localization. Our dataset contains photos of 91 objects types that would be easily recognizable by a 4 year old. With a total of 2.5 million labeled instances in 328k images, the creation of our dataset drew upon extensive crowd worker involvement via novel user interfaces for category detection, instance spotting and instance segmentation. We present a detailed statistical analysis of the dataset in comparison to PASCAL, ImageNet, and SUN. Finally, we provide baseline performance analysis for bounding box and segmentation detection results using a Deformable Parts Model.},

  abstract = {We present a method for detecting objects in images using a single deep neural network. Our approach, named SSD, discretizes the output space of bounding boxes into a set of default boxes over different aspect ratios and scales per feature map location. At prediction time, the network generates scores for the presence of each object category in each default box and produces adjustments to the box to better match the object shape. Additionally, the network combines predictions from multiple feature maps with different resolutions to naturally handle objects of various sizes. SSD is simple relative to methods that require object proposals because it completely eliminates proposal generation and subsequent pixel or feature resampling stages and encapsulates all computation in a single network. This makes SSD easy to train and straightforward to integrate into systems that require a detection component. Experimental results on the PASCAL VOC, COCO, and ILSVRC datasets confirm that SSD has competitive accuracy to methods that utilize an additional object proposal step and is much faster, while providing a unified framework for both training and inference. For 300x300 input, SSD achieves 74.3% mAP on VOC2007 test at 59 FPS on a Nvidia Titan X and for 512x512 input, SSD achieves 76.9% mAP, outperforming a comparable state of the art Faster R-CNN model. Compared to other single stage methods, SSD has much better accuracy even with a smaller input image size. Code is available at https://github.com/weiliu89/caffe/tree/ssd.},

  abstract = {Parallel to the very first music expressions as a human activity,
	developed under some kind of guidelines and precepts, there have
	arisen relentless efforts and attempts to achieve the long-lasting
	and stable representation of the musical products being created,
	in a way that would allow to recreate them as closely as posible
	to the original event.from the very beginning until the present days,
	have been many notation systems, formats, and expressions developed
	with this purpose in mind. With the incursion and implementation
	of the new digital technologies in the musical activity spheres,
	a new paradigm emerge in the representation and transmission of the
	musical work, culminating nowadays with the born of a new music document
	typology tha may be called digital music score or e-Score. The aim
	of this paper is lay down and approach to this new type of object
	for music texts reading, editing and transmission through a quantitive
	research, being the scope of the study to analyze and understand
	how electronic music scores (e-Score) are received, used and perceived
	by music students and teachers in any of the music learning centers
	in our country. The main purpose is to provide scientific evidence,
	through statistical methods, of the level of implementation and use
	of these new support type for music knowledge transmission, as well
	as the most influential aspects implied in perception of therm amongst
	musical community in Spain.},

With novel digitising techniques is now possible to have these books stored in digital format and accessible to a wider public. However it remains the problem of how to use them. DEBORA (Digital accEss to BOoks of the RenAissance) is a European project that aims to develop a system to interact with these books through world-wide networks. The main issue is to build a database accessible through client computers. That will require to built accompanying metadata that should characterise different components of the books as illuminated letters, banners, figures and key words in order to simplify and speed up the remote access. To solve these problems, digital image analysis algorithms regarding filtering, segmentation, separation of text from non-text, lines and word segmentation and word recognition were developed. Some novel ideas are presented and illustrated through examples.},

  abstract = {A Hidden Markov Model (HMM) is a powerful model in describing temporal sequences. The HMM parameters are usually estimated using Baum-Welch algorithm. However, it is well known that the Baum-Welch algorithm tends to arrive at local optimal points. In this report, we investigate the potential of the Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO) as an alternative method for HMM parameters estimation. The domain in this study is the recognition of handwritten music notations. Three observables: (i) sequence of ink patterns, (ii) stroke information and (iii) spatial information associated with eight musical symbols were recorded. Sixteen HMM models were built from the data. Eight HMM models for eight musical symbols were built from the parameters estimated using the Baum-Welch algorithm and the other eight models were built from the parameters estimated using PSO. The experiment shows that the performances of HMM models, using parameters estimated from PSO and Baum-Welch approach, are comparable. We suggest that PSO or a combination of PSO and Baum-Welch algorithm could be alternative approaches for the HMM parameters estimation.},

  abstract = {Tables are an easy way to represent information in a structural form. Table recognition is important for the extraction of such information from document images. Usually, modern OCR systems provide textual information coming from tables without recognizing actual table structure. However, recognition of table structure is important to get the contextual meaning of the contents. Table structure recognition in heterogeneous documents is challenging due to a variety of table layouts. It becomes harder where no physical rulings are present in a table. This work proposes a novel learning based methodology for the recognition of table contents in heterogeneous document images. Textual contents of documents are classified as table or non-table elements using a pre-trained neural network model. The output of the neural network is further enhanced by applying a contextual post processing on each element to correct the classifications errors if any. The system is trained using a subset of UNLV and UW3 document images and depicted more than 97% accuracy on a test set in detection of table and non-table elements.},

  abstract = {We introduce YOLO9000, a state-of-the-art, real-time object detection system that can detect over 9000 object categories. First we propose various improvements to the YOLO detection method, both novel and drawn from prior work. The improved model, YOLOv2, is state-of-the-art on standard detection tasks like PASCAL VOC and COCO. Using a novel, multi-scale training method the same YOLOv2 model can run at varying sizes, offering an easy tradeoff between speed and accuracy. At 67 FPS, YOLOv2 gets 76.8 mAP on VOC 2007. At 40 FPS, YOLOv2 gets 78.6 mAP, outperforming state-of-the-art methods like Faster RCNN with ResNet and SSD while still running significantly faster. Finally we propose a method to jointly train on object detection and classification. Using this method we train YOLO9000 simultaneously on the COCO detection dataset and the ImageNet classification dataset. Our joint training allows YOLO9000 to predict detections for object classes that dont have labelled detection data. We validate our approach on the ImageNet detection task. YOLO9000 gets 19.7 mAP on the ImageNet detection validation set despite only having detection data for 44 of the 200 classes. On the 156 classes not in COCO, YOLO9000 gets 16.0 mAP. YOLO9000 predicts detections for more than 9000 different object categories, all in real-time.},

The performance evaluation of the algorithm utilizes test images with ground-truth, evaluation metrics for binarization of textual and synthetic images, and a weight-based ranking procedure for the final result presentation. The proposed algorithms were tested with images including different types of document components and degradations. The results were compared with a number of known techniques in the literature.

Yet, the accessibility to these documents with respect to browsing and searching remained limited as full automatic transcription is often not possible or not sufficiently accurate. This paper proposes a novel reliable approach for template-based keyword spotting in historical handwritten documents. In particular, our framework makes use of different graph representations for segmented word images and a sophisticated matching procedure. Moreover, we extend our method to a spotting ensemble. In an exhaustive experimental evaluation on four widely used benchmark datasets we show that the proposed approach is able to keep up or even outperform several state-of-the-art methods for template- and learning-based keyword spotting.},

Binarization of scanned gray scale images is the first step in most document image analysis systems. Selection of an appropriate binarization method for an input image domain is a difficult problem. Typically, a human expert evaluates the binarized images according to his/her visual criteria. However, to conduct an objective evaluation, one needs to investigate how well the subsequent image analysis steps will perform on the binarized image. We call this approach goal-directed evaluation, and it can be used to evaluate other low-level image processing methods as well. Our evaluation of binarization methods is in the context of digit recognition, so we define the performance of the character recognition module as the objective measure. Eleven different locally adaptive binarization methods were evaluated, and Niblack's method gave the best performance.},

We introduce selective search which combines the strength of both an exhaustive search and segmentation. Like segmentation, we use the image structure to guide our sampling process. Like exhaustive search, we aim to capture all possible object locations. Instead of a single technique to generate possible object locations, we diversify our search and use a variety of complementary image partitionings to deal with as many image conditions as possible. Our selective search results in a small set of data-driven, class-independent, high quality locations, yielding 99 {\%} recall and a Mean Average Best Overlap of 0.879 at 10,097 locations. The reduced number of locations compared to an exhaustive search enables the use of stronger machine learning techniques and stronger appearance models for object recognition. In this paper we show that our selective search enables the use of the powerful Bag-of-Words model for recognition. The selective search software is made publicly available (Software:  http://disi.unitn.it/~uijlings/SelectiveSearch.html ).},

This paper presents a study on the reuse of models trained with data from a different collection, focusing on the contribution that the language model and the optical models have on the performance. An empirical evaluation is performed using data from Jeremy Bentham manuscripts with the aim of recognising a manuscript about a very different topic written by Jane Austen.},

  abstract = {Abstract Gradient descent training of neural networks can be done
	in either a batch or on-line manner. A widely held myth in the neural
	network community is that batch training is as fast or faster and/or
	more ‘correct’ than on-line training because it supposedly uses a
	better approximation of the true gradient for its weight updates.
	This paper explains why batch training is almost always slower than
	on-line training—often orders of magnitude slower—especially on large
	training sets. The main reason is due to the ability of on-line training
	to follow curves in the error surface throughout each epoch, which
	allows it to safely use a larger learning rate and thus converge
	with less iterations through the training data. Empirical results
	on a large (20,000-instance) speech recognition task and on 26 other
	learning tasks demonstrate that convergence can be reached significantly
	faster using on-line training than batch training, with no apparent
	difference in accuracy.},

  abstract = {The use of object proposals is an effective recent approach for increasing
	the computational efficiency of object detection. We propose a novel
	method for generating object bounding box proposals using edges.
	Edges provide a sparse yet informative representation of an image.
	Our main observation is that the number of contours that are wholly
	contained in a bounding box is indicative of the likelihood of the
	box containing an object. We propose a simple box objectness score
	that measures the number of edges that exist in the box minus those
	that are members of contours that overlap the box's boundary. Using
	efficient data structures, millions of candidate boxes can be evaluated
	in a fraction of a second, returning a ranked set of a few thousand
	top-scoring proposals. Using standard metrics, we show results that
	are significantly more accurate than the current state-of-the-art
	while being faster to compute. In particular, given just 1000 proposals
	we achieve over 96% object recall at overlap threshold of 0.5 and
	over 75% recall at the more challenging overlap of 0.7. Our approach
	runs in 0.25 seconds and we additionally demonstrate a near real-time
	variant with only minor loss in accuracy.},
