BibTeX2HTML is a collection of tools for producing automatically HTML
documents from bibliographies written in the BibTeX format. It
consists in three command line tools:

  - bib2bib is a filter tool that reads one or several bibliography
    files, filters the entries with respect to a given criterion, and
    outputs the list of selected keys together with a new bibliography
    file containing only the selected entries; 

  - bibtex2html is a translator that reads a bibliography file and
    outputs two HTML documents that respectively the cited
    bibliography in a nice presentation, and the original BibTeX file
    augmented with several transparent HTML links to allow easy 
    navigation.

  - aux2bib reads a .aux file as produced by LaTeX and writes
    to standard output a BibTeX file containing exactly the
    BibTeX entries refereed in the .aux file.

INSTALLATION
============

  You need Objective Caml >= 3.07 to compile the sources.

     It creates two binary files, "bibtex2html" and "bib2bib" .

     If you want  to build the documentation, do  "make doc" (You need
     both LaTeX and Hevea).

  2. Install with "make install".  You may need superuser permissions.

     (Note:  you  can  also  just  copy the  two  executables  in  any
      directory of your choice)

     To install the doc, do "make install-doc".
